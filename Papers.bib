In this commentary, the authors first ground the attraction (asymmetric dominance) effect in its historical context as a test of an important theoretical assumption from rational choice theory. Drawing on the research reported by scholars from many fields of study, the authors argue that the finding of an asymmetric dominance effect remains robust because it holds when the conditions of the study are essentially replicated. Next, the authors identify some of the factors that mitigate (and amplify) the attraction effect and then position the effect into a larger theoretical debate involving the extent to which preferences are constructed versus merely revealed. The authors conclude by arguing that researchers who try to measure values as well as choice architects who attempt to shape values must be sensitive to the context-dependent properties of choice behavior, as illustrated by the attraction effect.},

By considering the perceived benefits and costs of choice, it is proposed that satisfaction from choice is an inverted U-shaped function of the number of alternatives. This proposition is verified experimentally. It is further hypothesized that differences in cognitive costs affect the relative location of the function’s peak. Specifically, since—in large sets—perceptual costs of processing alternatives varying in shape are greater than for alternatives varying in color, the peak of the satisfaction function for the latter will lie to the right of the former. This prediction is also validated. The paper emphasizes the need for an explicit rationale for knowing how much choice is “enough.” © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We find that individuals are more likely to defer choice when the amount of information gained when gathering information is greater, when there is an opportunity to gather information again sooner, when the individuals discount less the future, and when the likelihood of having search fatigue is lower. We also consider the case in which individuals incur costs of restarting a process of information gathering, and when the individual has greater information about the extent of search fatigue.},

Depth of cognitive processing mediated the effect of option presentation on optimal choice (Experiment 4). Memory load was unlikely to be the underlying mechanism, as individual differences in working memory span did not predict optimal choice in the sequential condition (which places a greater memory load; Experiment 5), and manipulations of memory load did not reduce the beneﬁts of simultaneous presentation (Experiments 6a–6c). Instead, participants’ working memory span predicted optimal choice in the simultaneous condition (which allows for more in-depth processing; Experiment 5), and a manipulation of processing load eliminated the beneﬁts of simultaneous presentation (Experiment 7).},

In this article, we review an emerging stream of research that examines the ways in which viewing options sequentially as opposed to simultaneously influences people’s decisions. Multiple studies support the idea that viewing options simultaneously encourages people to compare the options and to focus on the ways in which the options differ from each other. In contrast, viewing options sequentially encourages people to process each option holistically by comparing the option with previously encountered options or a subjective reference point. Integrating research from judgment and decision making, consumer behavior, experimental economics, and eyewitness identification, we identify ways in which the different processing styles elicited by sequential- and simultaneous-presentation formats influence people’s judgment and decision making. This issue is particularly important because presenting options either sequentially or simultaneously is a key element of choice architecture.},

Likewise, the very concept of a utility function over lotteries in normative, prescriptive, and descriptive theory is mathematically equivalent to strict weak order preferences over those lotteries, while intransitive heuristic models violate such weak orders. Using new quantitative interdisciplinary methodologies, we dissociate the variability of choices from the structural inconsistency of preferences. We show that laboratory choice behavior among stimuli of a classical “intransitivity” paradigm is, in fact, consistent with variable strict weak order preferences. We find that decision makers act in accordance with a restrictive mathematical model that, for the behavioral sciences, is extraordinarily parsimonious. Our findings suggest that the best place to invest future behavioral decision research is not in the development of new intransitive decision models but rather in the specification of parsimonious models consistent with strict weak order(s), as well as heuristics and other process models that explain why preferences appear to be weakly ordered.},

	abstract = {Confidence in perceptual decisions is thought to reflect the probability of being correct. According to this view, confidence should be unaffected or minimally reduced by the presence of irrelevant alternatives. To test this prediction, we designed five experiments. In Experiment 1, participants had to identify the largest geometrical shape among two or three alternatives. In the three-alternative condition, one of the shapes was much smaller than the other two, being a clearly incorrect option. Counter-intuitively, confidence was higher when the irrelevant alternative was present, evidencing that confidence construction is more complex than previously thought. Four computational models were tested, only one of them accounting for the results. This model predicts that confidence increases monotonically with the number of irrelevant alternatives, a prediction we tested in Experiment 2. In Experiment 3, we evaluated whether this effect replicated in a categorical task, but we did not find supporting evidence. Experiments 4 and 5 allowed us to discard stimuli presentation time as a factor driving the effect. Our findings suggest that confidence models cannot ignore the effect of multiple, possibly irrelevant alternatives to build a thorough understanding of confidence.},

In the case of binary data, such as yes/no responses, or such as the presence/absence of a symptom or a behavior, theories often actually predict that certain response probabilities change monotonically in a specific direction and/or that certain response probabilities are bounded from above or below in specific ways. A regression analysis is not really true to such a theory in that it may leave out parsimonious constraints and in that extraneous assumptions like linearity or log-linearity, or even the assumption of a functional relationship, are dictated by the method rather than the theory. That mismatch may well bias the results of empirical analysis and jeopardize attempts at meaningful replication of psychological research. This tutorial shows how contemporary order-constrained methods can shed more light on such questions, using far weaker auxiliary assumptions, while also formulating more detailed, nuanced, and concise hypotheses, and allowing for quantitative model selection.},

This meta-analysis addresses the question of how many ﬁllers should be included in a lineup. Data from 17,088 participants across 14 experiments revealed a trade-off associated with increasing the number of lineup members. Innocent suspects receive better protection from larger lineups than from smaller lineups, but larger lineups also make it harder for eyewitnesses to identify guilty suspects. Expected cost analyses showed that the least costly lineup size depends on the base rate of suspect guilt and the cost of incriminating an innocent suspect. If incriminating an innocent suspect is considered 10 times as costly as failing to incriminate the true perpetrator (Blackstone ratio), then larger lineups would be less costly for the majority of possible base rates. Smaller lineups would only be less costly if the base rate of suspect guilt is high, or if incriminating an innocent suspect is considered to have minimal costs. There remains much to learn about lineup size and its potential interactions with ﬁller plausibility and the method of lineup presentation. Nevertheless, these preliminary results suggest that many jurisdictions would beneﬁt from increasing the minimum number of ﬁllers in their lineups.},

	abstract = {We propose that self-control failures, and variation across individuals in self-control abilities, are partly due to differences in the speed with which the decision-making circuitry processes basic attributes, such as tastiness, versus more abstract attributes, such as healthfulness. We tested these hypotheses by combining a dietary-choice task with a novel form of mouse tracking that allowed us to pinpoint when different attributes were being integrated into the choice process with temporal resolution at the millisecond level. We found that, on average, tastiness was processed about 195 ms earlier than healthfulness during the choice process. We also found that 13\% to 39\% of observed individual differences in self-control ability could be explained by differences in the relative speed with which tastiness and healthfulness were processed.},

For example, are unfixated choice options and attributes discounted compared to the currently fixated feature? This paper proposes a model that describes how fluctuations in attention to choice set features impacts decision-making. We test and find evidence for the model’s predictions across two laboratory studies where participants made incentivized choices between consuming multiattribute bundles as their eye movements were recorded. The first study finds that an attentional drift diffusion model accurately describes choices, response times, and how these variables are correlated with visual attention to attributes and options. On average, only 80\% of an unattended attribute’s value and 60\% of an unattended option’s value were integrated in the evidence accumulation process. The second study exogenously manipulated attention to features of the choice set and found this altered choices, as the model predicts. The attentional bias identified here causally affects decisions and has implications for understanding multiattribute choice.},

	abstract = {Many decision making theories assume a principle of sequentially sampling decision-relevant evidence from the stimulus environment, where sampled evidence is dynamically accumulated toward a threshold to trigger a decision in favour of the threshold-crossing option. A core prediction of sequential sampling models is that options more likely to be chosen are chosen more quickly. This result has been empirically supported hundreds of times for low-level speeded perceptual decisions – the traditional domain of sequential sampling models. More recently, sequential sampling models have been generalised and applied to higher-level preferential, or value-based, decisions – decisions for which there is no objectively correct option. Preferential options are typically composed of multiple attributes, like a phone deﬁned by its price, camera quality, memory capacity, and so on. Here, we show that decisions for such multi-attribute preferential options with deﬁned features violate the core prediction of sequential sampling models: options more likely to be chosen are not chosen more quickly. We ﬁnd this invariance across 4 data sets spanning multi-attribute choices made in unconstrained conditions, under time pressure, and for multi-attribute options with artiﬁcial or marketplace compositions. The result remains whether the relationship between choice frequency and choice time is inspected at the lower level of component attributes or the higher level of whole options. Our ﬁnding places critical constraints on the capacity to generalise sequential sampling models from low-level perceptual decisions to high-level multi-attribute preferential choice.},

In the present study, two monkeys performed a simple detection task with auditory, visual and audiovisual stimuli of different intensities and onset asynchronies. In its basic form, a Wiener diffusion superposition model provided only a poor description of the observed data, especially of the detection rate (i.e., accuracy or hit rate) for low stimulus intensity. We expanded the model in two ways, by (A) adding a temporal deadline, that is, restricting the evidence accumulation process to a stopping time, and (B) adding a second ‘‘nogo’’ barrier representing target absence. We present closed-form solutions for the mean absorption times and absorption probabilities for a Wiener diffusion process with a drift towards a single barrier in the presence of a temporal deadline (A), and numerically improved solutions for the two-barrier model (B). The best description of the data was obtained from the deadline model and substantially outperformed the two-barrier approach.},

The concurrent divided attention task is considered to consume the mental resources available for the choice task. There were three conditions: (a) the task-relevant condition, in which the auditory task should consume resources across multiple levels; (b) the task-irrelevant condition, in which the auditory stimuli should consume perceptual resources; (c) and the control condition, in which the resources should not be consumed by auditory stimuli. Thirty-three participants solved 24 hypothetical purchase problems with three alternatives that diﬀered in terms of two attributes. The results indicated that the choice proportion of the target was signiﬁcantly higher in the task-relevant condition than in the task-irrelevant and control conditions, thereby suggesting that a reduction in cognitive (and/or response) resources is critical for the attraction eﬀect.},

The current within-subjects study tested whether manipulating cognitive load affects the magnitude of attraction and compromise decoy effects. Participants (n = 96) made simulated online grocery shopping choices from three options described by price and quality for each grocery item they encountered. On half the 96 trials, they had to memorize a telephone number prior to encountering the choice set, after which they recalled the number. The choice task was rated significantly more difficult under load, providing some face validity for the load manipulation. Across decoy types, context effects were large and unaffected by the load manipulation. Bayesian analysis provided substantial evidence in favor of this null effect, with the study powered at better than .95 to detect a moderate effect. Across individuals, the magnitude of decoy effects was positively correlated with perception of the greater difficulty of the task under load, with this relationship fully mediated by increases in response times. These results are consistent with the idea that compromise and attraction decoy effects can operate relatively automatically and require minimal effortful processing.},

Using multiple point-light walkers and a classical contextual paradigm, we tested 72 college-age adults across six experiments and found that the perceived direction of the central walker was attracted toward the direction of the surrounding walkers. The observed contextual-attraction effect occurred even when the surrounding walkers differed from the central walker in gender and walking speed but disappeared when they were asynchronously presented or replaced by inanimate motion. Strikingly, this contextualattraction effect partially persisted in the context of local motion rather than static figures. These findings, in contrast to the typical contextual-repulsion effect, lend support for the distinctiveness of perceived social bonds on contextual modulation and suggest a specialized contextual mechanism tuned to social factors.},

This implies the evidence or support recruited to make these judgments is based on the descriptions of the events (hypotheses) instead of the events themselves, as captured by Tversky and Koehler’s (1994) support theory. Support theory, however, assumes each hypothesis elicits a fixed level of support (support invariance). Here, across three studies, we tested this support invariance assumption by asking participants to estimate the probability that an event would occur given a set of relevant statistics. We show that the support recruited about a target hypothesis can depend on the other hypotheses under consideration. Results reveal that for a pair of competing hypotheses, one hypothesis (the target hypothesis) appears more competitive relative to the other when a dud–a hypothesis dominated by the target hypothesis–is present. We also find that the target hypothesis can appear less competitive relative to the other when a resembler–a hypothesis that is similar to the target hypothesis–is present. These context effects invalidate the support invariance assumption in support theory and suggest that a similar process that drives preference construction may also underlie belief construction.},

Building on psychophysics, we examined two types of visual attributes: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative visual attributes (e.g., different bottle volumes) can be perceived as magnitudes. Qualitative visual attributes (e.g., different colors), however, do not fall onto a magnitude scale. One can perceive that a bottle’s volume is twice that of another bottle but not that a green bottle’s color is twice that of a red bottle. We observed robust attraction effects for quantitative visual attributes (4,602 adults, 237 college-age participants), which reversed to repulsion effects when the visual attributes were qualitative (6,005 adults).},

I argue here that measures of evidential strength should be stochastically ordered by both the effect size and the sample size. I consider the case that the data are normally distributed and show that, for that case, P-values are valid measures of evidential strength while Bayes factors are not. Specifically, I show that in a sharp Null hypothesis test the Bayes factor is stochastically ordered by the sample size only if the effect size or the sample size is sufficiently large.

Thus, the primary goal of the present study is to explore alternative- and dimension-level stimulus properties that promote the attraction, compromise, and similarity effects. The results suggest that increasing a dimension-level property, spread, promotes the attraction and compromise effects and reduces the similarity effect, whereas increasing an alternative-level property, dispersion, introduces an alternative-level bias that inﬂuences choice in concert with the decoy. The present work therefore provides new insights into the stimulus properties underlying context-dependent choice behavior and provides important new constraints for theoretical models that seek to account for such behavior.},

Further, the causal role of errors in these effects has been questioned due to confounds from slow fluctuations in attention caused by factors such as fatigue and boredom. In recognition memory tasks, we investigated both post-error speeding associated with instructions emphasising fast responding and post-error slowing associated with instructions emphasising the accuracy of responding. In order to identify the causes of post-error effects, we fit this data with evidence accumulation models using a method of measuring post-error effects that is robust to confounds from slow fluctuations. When the response-to-stimulus interval between trials was short, there were no post-error effect on accuracy and speeding and slowing were caused by differences in non-decision time (i.e. the time to encode choice stimuli and generate responses). In contrast, when the interval was longer, due to participants providing a confidence rating for their choice, there were also effects on the rate of evidence accumulation and the amount of evidence required for a decision. We discuss the implications of our methods and results for post-error effect research.},

In this paper, we outline eight behavioral ﬁndings regarding the causes and consequences of choice deferral that cognitive theories of decision making should be able to capture. We show that these ﬁndings can be accounted for by a deferral-based time limit applied to existing sequential sampling models of preferential choice. Our approach to modeling deferral as a time limit in a sequential sampling model also makes a number of novel predictions regarding the interactions between choice probabilities, deferral probabilities, and decision times, and we conﬁrm these predictions in an experiment. Choice deferral is a key feature of everyday decision making, and our paper illustrates how established theoretical approaches can be used to understand the cognitive underpinnings of this important behavioral phenomenon.},

The model uses a drift diffusion process to account for choice and decision time. To estimate confidence, we assume that evidence continues to accumulate after the choice. Judges then interrupt the process to categorize the accumulated evidence into a confidence rating. The model explains all known interrelationships between the 3 indices of performance. Furthermore, the model also accounts for the distributions of each variable in both a perceptual and general knowledge task. The dynamic nature of the model also reveals the moderating effects of time pressure on the accuracy of choice and confidence. Finally, the model specifies the optimal solution for giving the fastest choice and confidence rating for a given level of choice and confidence accuracy. Judges are found to act in a manner consistent with the optimal solution when making confidence judgments.},

The 2HT model was able to match the RT– confidence relationship for correct responses, but it was unable to match the same relationship for errors. The 1LT model could not match the RT– confidence relationship for either correct responses or errors. Only the 2LT model was able to match the full pattern. The differences between models were driven by their fundamental assumptions about memory retrieval: only the 2-threshold models could produce an RT– confidence relationship by mixing relatively fast responses from a detection state with relatively slow responses from an uncertain (“guess”) state, and only the 2LT model could do so for both correct and error responses because it allows misleading detection. Quantitative fits also showed that the 1LT model could not account for changes in confidence-rating distributions across memory-strength conditions, and thus this model performed substantially worse than the other two models even when RT data were not considered.},

Although it is generally agreed that contextual cuing arises via an associative learning mechanism, there is uncertainty about the type(s) of process(es) that allow learning to influence RT. We contrast two leading accounts of the contextual cuing effect that differ in terms of the general process that is credited with producing the effect. The first, the expedited search account, attributes the cuing effect to an increase in the speed with which the target is acquired. The second, the decision threshold account, attributes the cuing effect to a reduction in the response threshold used by observers when making a subsequent decision about the target (e.g., judging its orientation). We use the diffusion model to contrast the quantitative predictions of these two accounts at the level of individual observers. Our use of the diffusion model allows us to also explore a novel decision-level locus of the cuing effect based on perceptual learning. This novel account attributes the RT benefit to a perceptual learning process that increases the quality of information used to drive the decision process. Our results reveal both individual differences in the process(es) involved in contextual cuing but also identify several striking regularities across observers. We find strong support for both the decision threshold account as well as the novel perceptual learning account. We find relatively weak support for the expedited search account.},

As a result, recent years have seen the development of a number of psychological theories explaining context effects. However, much less attention has been given to the statistical analyses of context effects. Traditionally, context effects are measured as a change in preference for a target option across two different choice sets (the so-called relative choice share of the target, or RST). We first show that the frequently used definition of the RST measure has some weaknesses and should be replaced by a more appropriate definition that we provide. We then show through a large-scale simulation that the RST measure as previously defined can lead to biased inferences. As an alternative, we suggest a Bayesian approach to estimating an accurate RST measure that is robust to various circumstances. We applied the two approaches to the data of five published studies (total participants, N = 738), some of which used the biased approach. Additionally, we introduce the absolute choice share of the target (or AST) as the appropriate measure for the attraction effect. Our approach is an example of evaluating and proposing proper statistical tests for axiomatic principles of decision-making. After applying the AST and the robust RST to published studies, we found qualitatively different results in at least one-fourth of the cases. These results highlight the importance of utilizing robust statistical tests as a foundation for the development of new psychological theories.},

Two process-tracing studies simulated a 5-day college-course selection period in which new course alternatives appeared on each day. In a risk-free condition, no risks were associated with delay of decision making over the days. In a risk condition, each day of delay was associated with a risk of loss of existing course alternatives. Unlike decisive individuals, who modulated days of deliberation in response to presence versus absence of risk, indecisive individuals did not. The results illustrate not that indecisive individuals show uniformly increased delay relative to others, but rather that their delay behavior may be more striking in its unresponsiveness to risk.

Here we experimentally tested 2 of these mechanisms—time out and preference change—in a virtual hiring task to see whether participants hired more applicants when choosing from small relative to large sets of applicants. We further wanted to observe how the distribution of options affected choice. The choice overload effect replicated. More importantly, we observed that the time out mechanism did indeed account for choice overload effects, whereas the conﬂict-based preference change mechanism did not. Model ﬁtting via simulation provided converging support because the time-out model provided a superior ﬁt relative to the preference change model.

We considered three well-known models for estimating utility: (i) a linear multi-attribute model, (ii) equal weighting of attributes, and (iii) a single-attribute heuristic.

	abstract = {Context effects—preference changes that depend on the availability of other options—have attracted a great deal of attention among consumer researchers studying high-level decision tasks. In the experiments reported here, we showed that these effects also arise in simple perceptual-decision-making tasks. This finding casts doubt on explanations limited to consumer choice and high-level decisions, and it indicates that context effects may be amenable to a general explanation at the level of the basic decision process. We demonstrated for the first time that three important context effects from the preferential-choice literature—similarity, attraction, and compromise effects—all occurred within a single perceptual-decision task. Not only do our results challenge previous explanations for context effects proposed by consumer researchers, but they also challenge the choice rules assumed in theories of perceptual decision making.},

	abstract = {This article presents techniques for dealing with a form of dependency in data arising when numerical data sum to a constant for individual cases, that is, “compositional” or “ipsative” data. Examples are percentages that sum to 100, and hours in a day that sum to 24. Ipsative scales fell out of fashion in psychology during the 1960s and 1970s due to a lack of methods for analyzing them. However, ipsative scales have merits, and compositional data commonly occur in psychological research. Moreover, as we demonstrate, sometimes converting data to a compositional form yields insights not otherwise accessible. Fortunately, there are sound methods for analyzing compositional data. We seek to enable researchers to analyze compositional data by presenting appropriate techniques and illustrating their application to real data. First, we elaborate the technical details of compositional data and discuss both established and new approaches to their analysis. We then present applications of these methods to real social science datasets (data and code using R are available in a supplementary document). We conclude with a discussion of the state of the art in compositional data analysis and remaining unsolved problems. A brief guide to available software resources is provided in the ﬁrst section of the supplementary document.},

	abstract = {Over the past several decades, researchers in psychology, neuroscience, marketing, and economics have been keen to understand context effects in multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision-making. These effects occur when choices among existing alternatives are altered by the addition of a new alternative to the choice set. The effects violate classic decision theories and have led to the development of computational and mathematical models that explain how the effects arise due to underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms. This paper reviews the class of dynamic models of these effects, comparing mechanisms across models. We observe that most models of context effects incorporate an attention mechanism, suggesting attention plays an important role in multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision-making. We conclude by discussing recent empirical studies of attention and context effects and hypothesize that changes in attention could be responsible for recently observed reversals in context effects.},

How do decision makers determine in what sequence to collect information and when to stop? In two experiments, we administered a version of the German cities task developed by Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996), in which participants had to decide which of two cities had the larger population. Decision makers were not provided with the names of the cities, but they were able to collect different kinds of cues for both response alternatives (e.g., “Does this city have a university?”) before making a decision. Our experiments differed in whether participants were free to determine the number of cues they examined. We demonstrate that a novel model, using hierarchical latent mixtures and Bayesian inference (Lee \& Newell, 2011) provides a more complete description of the data from both experiments than simple conventional strategies, such as the take–the–best or the Weighted Additive heuristics.},

	abstract = {Understanding the cognitive and neural processes that underlie human decision making requires the successful prediction of how, but also of when, people choose. Sequential sampling models (SSMs) have greatly advanced the decision sciences by assuming decisions to emerge from a bounded evidence accumulation process so that response times (RTs) become predictable. Here, we demonstrate a difficulty of SSMs that occurs when people are not forced to respond at once but are allowed to sample information sequentially: The decision maker might decide to delay the choice and terminate the accumulation process temporarily, a scenario not accounted for by the standard SSM approach. We developed several SSMs for predicting RTs from two independent samples of an electroencephalography (EEG) and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. In these studies, participants bought or rejected fictitious stocks based on sequentially presented cues and were free to respond at any time. Standard SSM implementations did not describe RT distributions adequately. However, by adding a mechanism for postponing decisions to the model we obtained an accurate fit to the data. Timefrequency analysis of EEG data revealed alternating states of de- and increasing oscillatory power in beta-band frequencies (14–30 Hz), indicating that responses were repeatedly prepared and inhibited and thus lending further support for the existence of a decision not to decide. Finally, the extended model accounted for the results of an adapted version of our paradigm in which participants had to press a button for sampling more information. Our results show how computational modeling of decisions and RTs support a deeper understanding of the hidden dynamics in cognition.},

The findings from this research suggest that the decision to defer choice is sensitive to the uncertainty of choosing the most preferred option from the set of alternatives provided. Building on this research, the author tests whether the decision to defer choice is also influenced by task variables that influence decision uncertainty. In the first experiment, this proposition is tested for choice problems in which information on three relatively equally attractive alternatives is presented either sequentially or simultaneously. As predicted, the preference for the defer-choice option was greater when the three alternatives were presented simultaneously. A second study forced subjects into using one of four decision strategies in order to choose between two nondominated alternatives. The preference for the no-choice option was found to be higher when the rule required explicit attribute tradeoffs and lower when it simplified choice. These results suggest that choice uncertainty is influenced by the decision strategy used to determine the preference among alternatives. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the results for marketers’ communication strategies.},

They focus on two aspects of historical price information: the direction and the frequency of past price changes. The authors advance a theoretical framework which postulates that the interaction between these two factor shapes consumers’ decisions to buy now versus later. Controlling for the total magnitude of price changes, the authors propose that consumers are more likely to defer purchase when the price of the product has previously increased compared to when the price has decreased. Importantly, the authors hypothesize that this effect is more pronounced when consumers observe a single large change in price (e.g., an increase of \$100 versus a decrease of \$100) compared to when they observe multiple smaller changes that establish a trend (e.g., four decreases of \$25 versus four increases of \$25). The authors argue that these effects are driven by differences in consumers’ expectations about future prices. They test their predictions, as well as two moderators of the proposed effects—the monotonicity and the timing of price changes—in six well-powered pre-registered experimental studies (N = 5,713) using both hypothetical and actual purchases.},

In a conflict mindset, people should be better able to make tradeoffs and resolve choice conflict. We tested this proposition in 4 experiments, and demonstrated that priming conflicting goals before a decision increases choice in domains unrelated to the primed conflict. We further demonstrated that increased choice occurs because people in a conflict mindset process choice information more systematically, and we rule out several alternative explanations for the results.},

	abstract = {Self‐customization in online shopping contexts readily offers an abundance of options for consumers. However, the sheer amount of information can quickly become overwhelming. One way to give people the freedom to choose without overwhelming them with information is to simplify the decision process by breaking it down into a series of smaller steps. Contrary to a common assumption that simpler decisions increase choice likelihood, however, this study demonstrates that a simple byattribute self‐customization process may activate a maximizing mindset, which increases people's desire to find better options and decreases their satisfaction with the ones available. Consequently, simplifying the self‐customization process can sometimes backfire by decreasing choice likelihood. Three studies suggest that although by‐attribute self‐customization formats are easier to choose from, compared with more complex matrix formats, they may sometimes—paradoxically—increase choice deferral. The findings suggest that a maximizing mindset mediates this effect, casting doubt on information‐based alternative explanations. The findings also suggest that whether by‐attribute self‐customization increases or decreases choice likelihood may depend on the presence of objective quality cues, which indicate that an objectively‐best option can be found. This study furthers the understanding of how decision difficulty and maximizing influence self‐customization decisions.},

The model also explains the strengthening of the attraction effect that has been observed when deferral is permissible.

When this relation is complete, the model reduces to rational choice.},

Based on previous phase models of decision making and existing police policy in dealing with critical incidents of this nature, a descriptive SAFE-T (Situation Assessment, Formulate a plan, Execute a plan and Team learning) model was applied to team decision processes. Proximity and Lag Sequential analyses tested the occurrence of the predicted decision phases set out in the model; these results indicated that the model did not fully capture the complexity of the process. Speciﬁcally, further qualitative analyses (and comparisons to a ‘Gold Standard’ set of subject matter expert decisions, conducted with the beneﬁt of removing ambient and time pressure stressors) illustrated that a complex combination of ambient (uncertainty), cognitive (accountability pressures) and organizational (an existing blame culture and lack of policy) factors ‘derailed’ ofﬁcers from making ‘save life’ decisions. Instead, albeit in a minority of cases, they either made errors of omission by failing to make any decision at all or inappropriate choice deferrals (by insisting another agency made the decision or that the decision could be made later). The potential beneﬁts of making the SAFE-T decision process and how derailment can occur explicit in police critical incident training events are discussed.

Two theoretical approaches were contrasted: (1) The process approach predicting that choice deferral varies as a function of information form, and (2) the communication approach predicting an interaction of information form and domain-speciﬁc knowledge. Participants were presented with different laptops described in an absolute (e.g. ‘300 GB hard disc’), evaluative-numerical (e.g. ‘hard disc with 30 out of 100 points in an expert rating’) or evaluative-verbal (e.g. ‘bad hard disc’) information form, and they could choose to buy one of the laptops or defer. Domain-speciﬁc knowledge was also assessed. In Study 1, evaluativenumerical and evaluative-verbal values led to more deferral in people with high domainspeciﬁc knowledge. The pattern for evaluative-numerical and evaluative-verbal values was replicated for a different information organization in Study 2. Study 3 showed that absolute values led to more deferral the less knowledgeable participants were and demonstrated that domain-speciﬁc knowledge and deferral were unrelated when absolute and evaluative-verbal values were presented in combination. In sum, the results support the communication approach and have methodological implications for decision research and theoretical implications for understanding choice deferral in real-life decisions.},

The results of a comparative analysis based on previous studies' effect sizes suggest that, compared to decisions on fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), the amount of cognitive effort spent on decisions regarding durables fosters the compromise effect. A second study supports this notion by showing that, regarding choices between durables, the compromise effect diminishes under a serotonin-deﬁciency-induced cognitive impairment, but its decrease is not as pronounced as with FMCG.},

Based on the notion that elevated power reduces regret anticipation—the fear of making a wrong choice—it is proposed that power inﬂuences the extent of choice deferral by reducing consumers' susceptibility to anticipated regret. Because of the regret-based mechanism, power can increase or decrease consumers' propensity to defer choice, depending upon the situational factors that are associated with anticipated regret, such as salience of regret, outcome reversibility (e.g., return policy), and locus-of-regret (postponing vs. choosing now). Using different manipulations of power, seven studies provide consistent support for the proposed effects and show that situational factors and marketing strategies can induce, turn off, or even reverse the effect of power on deferral. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications are discussed.},

The number of deferrals made in a controlled laboratory experiment that were inferred to be due to no options being good enough, decreased as the number of options increased. In contrast, the number of deferrals inferred to be due to there being uncertainty regarding which option was the best, increased. Observing these two effects simultaneously helps to explain the inconsistent results observed in previous research.

The authors show that a key determinant of the effect is the order in which “whether to buy” and “which option to choose” decisions are made. Increasing assortment size has a more positive effect on the likelihood of consumers to make a purchase when the initial decision emphasis is on whether to make a purchase from a given set of options, as opposed to ﬁrst identifying the best available option in the set. This prediction is based on the proposition that decision order determines how likely consumers are to make trade-offs between the perceived costs and beneﬁts associated with a large product assortment, and that the beneﬁts are given relatively greater weight when consumers decide ﬁrst “whether to buy” (rather than “which option to choose”). Two incentive-compatible studies, using a systematic manipulation of assortment size and decision order, support the prediction.},

To reconcile these two positions, we tested whether there are specific conditions in which the too-much-choice effect is more or less likely to occur. In three studies with a total of 598 participants, we systematically investigated the moderating impact of choice set sizes, option attractiveness, and whether participants had to justify their choices. We also tested the moderating role of search behavior, domain-specific expertise, and participants’ tendency to maximize, in a within-subject design. Overall, only choice justification proved to be an effective moderator, calling the extent of the too-much-choice effect into question.

In this paper, we show this is not always the case. We introduce the construct “assortment type” and demonstrate that the effect of assortment size on brand share is systematically moderated by assortment type. We define an “alignable” assortment as a set of brand variants that differ along a single, compensatory dimension such that choosing from that assortment only requires within-attribute trade-offs. In contrast, we define a “nonalignable” assortment as a set of brand variants that simultaneously vary along multiple, noncompensatory dimensions, demanding between-attribute trade-offs. In turn, we argue that an alignable assortment can efficiently meet the diverse tastes of consumers, thereby increasing brand share, but that a nonalignable assortment increases both the cognitive effort and the potential for regret faced by a consumer, thereby decreasing brand share. We term this effect “overchoice.”
            Across three studies, we provide evidence of overchoice and tie the effect to the effort and regret brought about by nonalignability. In the process, we demonstrate that simplification of information presentation, reversibility of choice, and a reduction in underlying nonalignability serve to reduce or eliminate this effect.},

Behavioral and economic models of choice processes are difficult to estimate when using stated and revealed preferences because the underlying process is latent. This paper introduces Bayesian methods for estimating two behavioral models that eliminate alternatives using specific attribute-levels. The elimination by aspects theory postulates a sequential elimination of alternatives by attribute levels until a single one, the chosen alternative remains. In the economic screening rule model, respondents screen out alternatives with certain attribute levels, and then choose from the remaining alternatives using a compensatory function of all the attributes. The economic screening rule model gives an economic justification as to why certain attributes are used to screen alternatives. A commercial conjoint study is used to illustrate the methods and assess their performance. In this dataset, the economic screening rule model outperforms the EBA and other standard choice models.},

	abstract = {Despite the voluminous evidence in support of the paradoxical ﬁnding that providing individuals with more options can be detrimental to choice, the question of whether and when large assortments impede choice remains open. Even though extant research has identiﬁed a variety of antecedents and consequences of choice overload, the ﬁndings of the individual studies fail to come together into a cohesive understanding of when large assortments can beneﬁt choice and when they can be detrimental to choice. In a meta-analysis of 99 observations (N = 7202) reported by prior research, we identify four key factors—choice set complexity, decision task difﬁculty, preference uncertainty, and decision goal—that moderate the impact of assortment size on choice overload. We further show that each of these four factors has a reliable and signiﬁcant impact on choice overload, whereby higher levels of decision task difﬁculty, greater choice set complexity, higher preference uncertainty, and a more prominent, effort-minimizing goal facilitate choice overload. We also ﬁnd that four of the measures of choice overload used in prior research—satisfaction/conﬁdence, regret, choice deferral, and switching likelihood—are equally powerful measures of choice overload and can be used interchangeably. Finally, we document that when moderating variables are taken into account the overall effect of assortment size on choice overload is signiﬁcant—a ﬁnding counter to the data reported by prior meta-analytic research.},

Using a variety of measures, we find that the active choices (i.e., those that exclude the deferral outside option) of subjects in the nonforced‐choice treatment are generally more consistent. We also find that the combined deferral and active‐choice behavior of subjects in that treatment is explained better by a model of dominant choice with incomplete preferences than it is by rational choice. Our results suggest that nonforced‐choice experiments and models can be helpful in separating people's rational, hesitant/not‐yet‐rational and genuinely irrational behavior, and can potentially offer important new insights in revealed preference analysis.},

	abstract = {Time pressure (TP) constrains consumers’ decisions: stores have ﬁxed opening hours, promotions have deadlines, and a house for rent may not be available tomorrow. Evidence about the impact of TP on decision-making suggests that when facing complex decisions, consumers do not process all the information, ground decisions upon a restricted set of attributes, and are less likely to defer choices, but still accomplish utility choices. However, these effects of TP have been typically observed in experimental paradigms that manipulate speciﬁc deadlines for task completion. In two experiments involving consumer goods and service choices we have introduced two additional TP manipulations (time limited price discount and stock-out threat), building an integrative approach where information processing strategies, choice deferral, and ﬁnal choice utility were measured. Our results emphasize the differences between TP manipulations. When applied to real buying contexts, price discounts may not be so effective anymore, whereas stock-out threats have surprising effects, decreasing deferral and ﬁnal choice utility. These ﬁndings contribute to a better understanding of the differences between decision-making upon consumer goods and services, discriminating the effects of TP in real scenarios.},

As the authors predict, subjective experiences of difficulty increase choice deferral (Studies 1 and 2) and the selection of a compromise option (Studies 3 and 4), unless consumers are induced to attribute the experience to an unrelated cause.

A group of children (12-year-olds), young adults (20year-olds), and older adults (65+-year-olds) were presented with a classic syllogistic reasoning task and a decision-making questionnaire. Results indicated that on syllogisms where beliefs and logic conﬂicted, reasoning performance showed the expected curvilinear age trend: Reasoning performance initially increased from childhood to early adulthood but declined again in later life. On syllogisms where beliefs and logic were consistent and sound reasoning did not require belief inhibition, however, age did not affect performance. Furthermore, across the lifespan we observed that the better people were at resisting intuitive temptations in the decision-making task, the less they were biased by their beliefs on the conﬂict syllogisms. As with the effect of age, one’s ability to override intuitions in the decision-making task did not mediate reasoning performance on the no-conﬂict syllogisms. Results lend credence to the postulated central role of inhibitory processing in those situations where beliefs and logic conﬂict.},

	abstract = {Sellers are often more interested in inducing buyers to make a choice—any choice—than in influencing which option they choose. For example, many retailers are more concerned about maximizing customer purchases within categories than influencing which brand is purchased in any particular category. Although this issue is important to researchers and practitioners, research on how contextual factors, such as decoys and prior decisions, affect whether consumers will “choose to choose” is scarce. We propose a reference-dependent model to fill this gap. This model unites several streams of research and leads to novel predictions that are tested and supported in four experiments. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.

	abstract = {Despite the voluminous evidence in support of the paradoxical ﬁnding that providing individuals with more options can be detrimental to choice, the question of whether and when large assortments impede choice remains open. Even though extant research has identiﬁed a variety of antecedents and consequences of choice overload, the ﬁndings of the individual studies fail to come together into a cohesive understanding of when large assortments can beneﬁt choice and when they can be detrimental to choice. In a meta-analysis of 99 observations (N = 7202) reported by prior research, we identify four key factors—choice set complexity, decision task difﬁculty, preference uncertainty, and decision goal—that moderate the impact of assortment size on choice overload. We further show that each of these four factors has a reliable and signiﬁcant impact on choice overload, whereby higher levels of decision task difﬁculty, greater choice set complexity, higher preference uncertainty, and a more prominent, effort-minimizing goal facilitate choice overload. We also ﬁnd that four of the measures of choice overload used in prior research—satisfaction/conﬁdence, regret, choice deferral, and switching likelihood—are equally powerful measures of choice overload and can be used interchangeably. Finally, we document that when moderating variables are taken into account the overall effect of assortment size on choice overload is signiﬁcant—a ﬁnding counter to the data reported by prior meta-analytic research.},

These reasons form the basis of the 2-stage, 2-threshold (2S2T) framework, which posits that a different kind of processing corresponds to these 2 reasons for choice deferral: absolute evaluations and relative comparisons, respectively. Three experiments are reported in which each type of processing was triggered in different conditions either via different payoff structures or different degrees of attribute knowledge. The effects of the 3 main independent variables (the size of the choice set, the utility of the best option, and the number of competitive options) differed depending on the payoff structure or attribute knowledge conditions in ways predicted by the 2S2T framework.

	abstract = {A multitude of models have been proposed to account for the neural mechanism of value integration and decision making in speeded decision tasks. While most of these models account for existing data, they largely disagree on a fundamental characteristic of the choice mechanism: independent versus different types of competitive processing. Five models, an independent race model, 2 types of input competition models (normalized race and feed-forward inhibition [FFI]) and 2 types of response competition models (max-minus-next [MMN] diffusion and leaky competing accumulators [LCA]) were compared in 3 combined computational and experimental studies. In each study, difficulty was manipulated in a way that produced qualitatively distinct predictions from the different classes of models. When parameters were constrained by the experimental conditions to avoid mimicking, simulations demonstrated that independent models predict speedups in response time with increased difficulty, while response competition models predict the opposite. Predictions of input-competition models vary between specific models and experimental conditions. Taken together, the combined computational and empirical findings provide support for the notion that decisional processes are intrinsically competitive and that this competition is likely to kick in at a late (response), rather than early (input), processing stage.},

Prior research on choice deferral has presented the no-choice option as just another response option (i.e., an unconditional brand-choice response mode), which has its primary focus on the selection decision. However, consumers in many marketplace situations may consider the buy/no-buy decision before the selection decision (i.e., a buy/no-buy response mode). This article examines the differences in evaluation processes and choice deferral for the two response modes. The authors' theoretical account suggests that an initial focus on the buy/no-buy decision activates greater use of alternative-based evaluations, thus making purchase deferral more sensitive to the valence of shared features and category reference information than in the unconditional brand-choice mode. The authors provide process evidence for their account and consider limiting conditions.},

The task has a long history in psychology and modern applications in the clinical/neuropsychological domain. In this article, we ﬁt a diffusion model to both experimental and simulated data. The model is the same as the two-choice model and assumes that there are two decision boundaries and termination at one of them produces a response, and at the other, the subject waits out the trial. In prior modeling, both two-choice and go/no-go data were ﬁt simultaneously, and only group data were ﬁt. Here the model is ﬁt to just go/no-go data for individual subjects. This allows analyses of individual differences, which is important for clinical applications. First, we ﬁt the standard two-choice model to two-choice data and ﬁt the go/no-go model to reaction times (RTs) from one of the choices and accuracy from the two-choice data. Parameter values were similar between the models and had high correlations. The go/no-go model was also ﬁt to data from a go/no-go version of the task with the same subjects as the two-choice task. A simulation study with ranges of parameter values that are obtained in practice showed similar parameter recovery between the two-choice and go/no-go models. Results show that a diffusion model with an implicit (no response) boundary can be ﬁt to data with almost the same accuracy as ﬁtting the two-choice model to two-choice data.},

Here, we united these two literatures, testing in two experiments with adults (total N = 200) whether prior comparative decisions bias cognitive and perceptual judgments in opposing directions or whether anchoring and repulsion are two domain-general biases whose co-occurrence has so far gone undetected. We found that in both perceptual and cognitive tasks, anchoring and repulsion co-occur. Further, the direction of the bias depends on the comparison value: Distant values attract judgments, whereas nearby values repulse judgments. Because none of the leading theories for either effect account for both biases, theoretical integration is needed. As a starting point, we describe one such joint theory based on sampling models of cognition.},

However, empirical links between the two opposing effects are scarce and theoretical accounts are missing altogether. The present study (N = 55) used eye tracking alongside a withinsubject design that contrasts a perceptual task and a preferential-choice analog in order to bridge this gap and uncover the underlying information-search processes. Although individuals differed in their perceptual and preferential choices, they generally engaged in alternative-wise comparisons and a repulsion effect was present in both conditions that became weaker the more predominant the attribute-wise comparisons were.

	abstract = {Objectives Eyewitness misidentifications have been implicated in many of the DNA exoneration cases that have come to light in recent years. One reform designed to address this problem involves switching from simultaneous lineups to sequential lineups, and our goal was to test the diagnostic accuracy of these two procedures using actual eyewitnesses.
Methods In a recent randomized field trial comparing the performance of simultaneous and sequential lineups in the real world, suspect ID rates were found to be similar for the two procedures. Filler ID rates were found to be slightly (but, in the key test, nonsignificantly) higher for simultaneous than sequential lineups, but fillers will not be prosecuted even if identified. Moreover, filler IDs may not provide reliable information about innocent suspect IDs. Here, we use two different proxy measures for ground truth of guilt versus innocence for suspects identified from simultaneous or sequential lineups in that same field study.
Results The results indicate that innocent suspects are, if anything, less likely to be mistakenly identified—and guilty suspects are more likely to be correctly identified—from simultaneous lineups compared to sequential lineups.
Conclusions Filler identifications are not necessarily predictive of the more consequential error of misidentifying an innocent suspect. With regard to actual suspect identifications, simultaneous lineups are diagnostically superior to sequential lineups. These findings are consistent with recent laboratory-based studies using receiver operating characteristic analysis suggesting that simultaneous lineups make it easier for eyewitnesses to tell the difference between innocent and guilty suspects.},

	abstract = {When evaluating cognitive models based on fits to observed data (or, really, any model that has free parameters), parameter estimation is critically important. Traditional techniques like hill climbing by minimizing or maximizing a fit statistic often result in point estimates. Bayesian approaches instead estimate parameters as posterior probability distributions, and thus naturally account for the uncertainty associated with parameter estimation; Bayesian approaches also offer powerful and principled methods for model comparison. Although software applications such as WinBUGS (Lunn, Thomas, Best, \& Spiegelhalter, Statistics and Computing, 10, 325–337, 2000) and JAGS (Plummer, 2003) provide Bturnkey{\textasciicircum}-style packages for Bayesian inference, they can be inefficient when dealing with models whose parameters are correlated, which is often the case for cognitive models, and they can impose significant technical barriers to adding custom distributions, which is often necessary when implementing cognitive models within a Bayesian framework. A recently developed software package called Stan (Stan Development Team, 2015) can solve both problems, as well as provide a turnkey solution to Bayesian inference. We present a tutorial on how to use Stan and how to add custom distributions to it, with an example using the linear ballistic accumulator model (Brown \& Heathcote, Cognitive Psychology, 57, 153–178. doi:10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.002, 2008).},

We provide a synthesis of formal models of risky, multiattribute, and intertemporal choice, three important domains in decision making. We identify recurring insights discovered by scholars of diﬀerent generations and diﬀerent disciplines across these three domains, and use these insights to classify over 150 existing models as involving various combinations of eight key mathematical and computational properties. These properties capture the main avenues of theoretical development in decision making research and can be used to understand the similarities and diﬀerences between decision models, aiding both theoretical analyses and empirical tests.},

In recent years, psychological research has driven a movement to reform the procedures that police use to obtain eyewitness identification evidence. This reform movement has been based in part on an argument suggesting that recommended procedures reduce the risk of false identifications with little or no reduction in the rate of correct identifications. A review of the empirical literature, however, challenges this no-cost view. With only one exception, changes in eyewitness identification procedures that reduce the risk of false identification of the innocent also reduce the likelihood of correct identification of the guilty.The implication that criminals may escape prosecution as a result of procedures implemented to protect the innocent makes policy decisions far more complicated than they would otherwise be under the no-cost view. These costs (correct identifications lost) and benefits (false identifications avoided) are discussed in terms of probative value and expected utility.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Eyewitness misidentifications have contributed to many wrongful convictions later overturned by DNA evidence. In response, many useful reforms have been introduced to protect the innocent. However, some police practices designed to protect the innocent also protect the guilty. We investigated a method for selecting fillers in a police lineup that protects the innocent while also making it easier to identify guilty suspects. Intuitively, fair lineups are created by choosing fillers who are similar in appearance to the suspect. However, we found that choosing fillers who match the description of the perpetrator but who are otherwise dissimilar to the suspect’s appearance yield fair lineups and enhance eyewitness identification performance. It does so by imperiling the guilty while protecting the innocent.
          , 
            A typical police lineup contains a photo of one suspect (who is innocent in a target-absent lineup and guilty in a target-present lineup) plus photos of five or more fillers who are known to be innocent. To create a fair lineup in which the suspect does not stand out, two filler selection methods are commonly used. In the first, fillers are selected if they are similar in appearance to the suspect. In the second, fillers are selected if they possess facial features included in the witness’s description of the culprit (e.g., “20-y-old white male”). The police sometimes use a combination of the two methods by selecting description-matched fillers whose appearance is also similar to that of the suspect in the lineup. Decades of research on which approach is better remains unsettled. Here, we tested a counterintuitive prediction made by a formal model based on signal detection theory: From a pool of acceptable description-matched photos, selecting fillers whose appearance is otherwise dissimilar to the suspect should increase the hit rate without affecting the false-alarm rate (increasing discriminability). In Experiment 1, we confirmed this prediction using a standard mock-crime paradigm. In Experiment 2, the effect on discriminability was reversed (as also predicted by the model) when fillers were matched on similarity to the perpetrator in both target-present and target-absent lineups. These findings suggest that signal-detection theory offers a useful theoretical framework for understanding eyewitness identification decisions made from a police lineup.},

	abstract = {Effect sizes are underappreciated and often misinterpreted—the most common mistakes being to describe them in ways that are uninformative (e.g., using arbitrary standards) or misleading (e.g., squaring effect-size rs). We propose that effect sizes can be usefully evaluated by comparing them with well-understood benchmarks or by considering them in terms of concrete consequences. In that light, we conclude that when reliably estimated (a critical consideration), an effect-size r of .05 indicates an effect that is very small for the explanation of single events but potentially consequential in the not-very-long run, an effect-size r of .10 indicates an effect that is still small at the level of single events but potentially more ultimately consequential, an effect-size r of .20 indicates a medium effect that is of some explanatory and practical use even in the short run and therefore even more important, and an effect-size r of .30 indicates a large effect that is potentially powerful in both the short and the long run. A very large effect size (r = .40 or greater) in the context of psychological research is likely to be a gross overestimate that will rarely be found in a large sample or in a replication. Our goal is to help advance the treatment of effect sizes so that rather than being numbers that are ignored, reported without interpretation, or interpreted superficially or incorrectly, they become aspects of research reports that can better inform the application and theoretical development of psychological research.},

We consider its implications for power analyses, the precision of estimated effects, and the planning of original and replication research. With heterogeneity and an interest in generalizing to a population of studies, the usual power calculations and confidence intervals are likely misleading, and the preference for single definitive large-N studies is misguided.

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an eﬀect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect eﬀects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of eﬀects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-ﬁre way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their ﬂexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

The typology of unpublished studies provides a descriptive scheme that can facilitate understanding of the population of study results across the field of psychology, within subdisciplines of psychology, or within specific psychology research domains.

The goal of model selection is to identify the model, from a set of candidate models, that permits the shortest description length (code) of the data. Since Rissanen originally formalized the problem using the crude ‘two-part code’ MDL method in the 1970s, many signiﬁcant strides have been made, especially in the 1990s, with the culmination of the development of the reﬁned ‘universal code’ MDL method, dubbed Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML). It represents an elegant solution to the model selection problem. The present paper provides a tutorial review on these latest developments with a special focus on NML.

This is a difficult problem because of the complexity of psychological models (e.g., their many parameters) and because the behavioral precision of models (e.g., interval-scale performance) often mismatches their testable precision in experiments, where qualitative, ordinal predictions are the norm. Parameter space partitioning is a solution that evaluates model performance at a qualitative level. There exists a partition on the model’s parameter space that divides it into regions that correspond to each data pattern. Three application examples demonstrate its potential and versatility for studying the global behavior of psychological models.},

	abstract = {Psychological embeddings provide a powerful formalism for characterizing human-perceived similarity among members of a stimulus set. Obtaining high-quality embeddings can be costly due to algorithm design, software deployment, and participant compensation. This work aims to advance state-of-the-art embedding techniques and provide a comprehensive software package that makes obtaining high-quality psychological embeddings both easy and relatively efficient. Contributions are made on four fronts. First, the embedding procedure allows multiple trial configurations (e.g., triplets) to be used for collecting similarity judgments from participants. For example, trials can be configured to collect triplet comparisons or to sort items into groups. Second, a likelihood model is provided for three classes of similarity kernels allowing users to easily infer the parameters of their preferred model using gradient descent. Third, an active selection algorithm is provided that makes data collection more efficient by proposing comparisons that provide the strongest constraints on the embedding. Fourth, the likelihood model allows the specification of group-specific attention weight parameters. A series of experiments are included to highlight each of these contributions and their impact on converging to a high-quality embedding. Collectively, these incremental improvements provide a powerful and complete set of tools for inferring psychological embeddings. The relevant tools are available as the Python package PsiZ, which can be cloned from GitHub (https://github.com/roads/psiz).},

	abstract = {The conceptual frameworks provided by both the lineups-as-experiments analogy and signal detection theory have proven important to understanding how eyewitness lineups work. The lineups-as-experiments analogy proposes that when investigators use a lineup procedure, they are acting as experimenters and should therefore follow the same tried-and-true procedures that experimenters follow when executing an experiment. Signal detection theory offers a framework for distinguishing between factors that improve the trade-off between culprit and innocent-suspect identifications and factors that affect the frequency of suspect identifications. We integrate these two conceptual frameworks. We argue that an eyewitness lineup procedure is characterized by two simultaneous signal detection tasks. On one hand, the witness is tasked with determining whether the culprit is present in the lineup and identifying that person. On the other hand, the investigator knows which lineup member is the suspect and which lineup members are known-innocent fillers and is therefore tasked only with determining whether the suspect is the culprit. The investigator uses the witness’s identification decision and associated level of confidence to decide whether the suspect is the culprit. We leverage this realization to demonstrate a method for creating full receiver operating characteristic curves for eyewitness lineup procedures.},

	abstract = {The dominant paradigm for inference in psychology is a null-hypothesis significance testing one. Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology’s lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and largeN designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

In addition, the accuracy of identifications associated with different eyewitness memory procedures has long been evaluated using measures like the diagnosticity ratio (the correct identification rate divided by the false identification rate). Framed in terms of signal-detection theory, both the absolute/relative distinction and the diagnosticity ratio are mainly relevant to response bias while remaining silent about the key issue of diagnostic accuracy, or discriminability (i.e., the ability to tell the difference between innocent and guilty suspects in a lineup). Here, we propose a signal-detection-based model of eyewitness identification, one that encourages the use of (and helps to conceptualize) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to measure discriminability. Recent ROC analyses indicate that the simultaneous presentation of faces in a lineup yields higher discriminability than the presentation of faces in isolation, and we propose a diagnostic feature-detection hypothesis to account for that result. According to this hypothesis, the simultaneous presentation of faces allows the eyewitness to appreciate that certain facial features (viz., those that are shared by everyone in the lineup) are non-diagnostic of guilt. To the extent that those non-diagnostic features are discounted in favor of potentially more diagnostic features, the ability to discriminate innocent from guilty suspects will be enhanced.},

In the ﬁeld of multi-alternative multi-attribute decision-making research, 3 preference reversals received special attention: similarity, attraction, and compromise eﬀects. The 3 so-called context eﬀects are changes in (relative) choice probabilities for 2 choice alternatives after a third “decoy” option is added to the set. Despite their simplicity, the eﬀects demonstrate that choice probabilities in multi-alternative decision making are contingent on the local context, that is, on the choice set under consideration. Because of their simplicity, on the other hand, similarity, attraction, and compromise eﬀects have been successfully examined in numerous studies to date, and they have become of increasing interest for diﬀerentiating between computational cognitive process models of multi-alternative multi-attribute decision making. However, the stimulus arrangement for producing the eﬀects seems to vary between studies, which becomes challenging when model accounts are compared.

In a forced choice task, the similarity between a target and a choice, appears to depend on the other choices. Speciﬁcally, introducing a distractor grouped with one of the options would reduce preference for the grouped option. However, the diagnosticity effect has been difﬁcult to replicate, casting doubt on its robustness and our understanding of contextual effects in similarity generally. We propose that the apparent brittleness of the diagnosticity effect is because it is in competition with an opposite attraction effect. Even though in both the similarity and decision-making literatures there are indications for such a competition, we provide the ﬁrst direct experimental demonstration of how an attraction effect can give way to a diagnosticity one, as a distractor option is manipulated.},

This paper provides an existence proof of a new approach in the form of a multi-agent system based on the principles of voting geometry. Assuming there are a number of neural systems (agents) within an individual’s brain, the Big Three decision anomalies can arise as a natural consequence of aggregating preferences across these agents. We operationalize these principles in VAMP, (Voting Agent Model of Preferences), and compare its performance to existing computational models as well as to empirical data. This provides a fundamentally different lens for understanding decision anomalies in multi-attribute choice.},

Using a within-subject experimental design, participants in 2 studies repeatedly choose among sets of options (consumer products) described on several attributes. The results of Study 1 showed that all models predicted participants’ choices equally well. In Study 2, in which the choice sets were explicitly designed to distinguish the models, MDFT had an advantage in predicting the observed choices. Study 2 further revealed the occurrence of multiple context effects within single participants, indicating an interdependent evaluation of choice options and correlations between different context effects. In sum, the results indicate that sequential sampling models can provide relevant insights into the cognitive process underlying preferential choices and thus can lead to better choice predictions.},

It is assumed that the associations between an attribute and an available alternative impact the attribute’s accessibility. The values of highly accessible attributes are more likely to be aggregated into preferences. Altering the choice task by adding new alternatives or by increasing the salience of preexisting alternatives can change the accessibility of the underlying attributes and subsequently bias choice. This mechanism is formalized by use of a preference accumulation decision process, embedded in a feed-forward neural network. The resulting model provides a unitary explanation for a large range of choice-set-dependent behaviors, including context effects, alignability effects, and less is more effects. The model also generates a gain–loss asymmetry relative to the reference point, without explicit loss aversion. This asymmetry accounts for all of the reference-dependent anomalies explained by loss aversion, as well as referencedependent phenomena not captured by loss aversion.},

Because heuristics do not require all available information, they are thought to be easy to implement and to not tax limited cognitive resources, which has led heuristics to be characterized as fast-and-frugal. We question this monolithic conception of heuristics by contrasting the cognitive demands of two popular heuristics, Tallying and Take-the-Best. We contend that heuristics that are frugal in terms of information usage may not always be fast because of the attentional control required to implement this focus in certain contexts. In support of this hypothesis, we find that Take-the-Best, while being more frugal in terms of information usage, is slower to implement and fares worse under time pressure manipulations than Tallying. This effect is then reversed when search costs for Take-the-Best are reduced by changing the format of the stimuli. These findings suggest that heuristics are heterogeneous and should be unpacked according to their cognitive demands to determine the circumstances a heuristic best applies.},

Previous research has shown that emotional states characterized by an intolerance of uncertainty, such as anxiety, can affect performance on visual detection tasks. It is unclear, however, to what extent these effects are a result of increased perceptual ability, a decisional bias, or both. The present study used signal detection theory to determine whether uncertain emotional states affect perceptual discriminability and/or decisional bias. In 2 experiments, an anxious, angry, or calm emotional state was induced, and participants were asked to identify which of a series of noisy images contained an embedded target image. The target images were either faces or houses. Emotional state had no effect on decisional bias for either target, but the ability to detect a face was higher for anxious participants. No effect on discriminability was found for houses. These results suggest that emotional state can change perceptual discriminability, but that this change may be limited to certain stimulus classes.},

	abstract = {A context eﬀect is a change in preference that occurs when alternatives are added to a choice set. Models of preferential choice that account for context eﬀects largely assume a within-dimension comparison process. It has been shown, however, that the format in which a choice set is presented can inﬂuence comparison strategies. That is, a by-alternative or by-dimension grouping of the dimension values encourage within-alternative or within-dimension comparisons, respectively. For example, one classic context eﬀect, the compromise eﬀect, is strengthened by a by-dimension presentation format. Extrapolation from this result suggests that a second context eﬀect, the similarity eﬀect, will actually reverse when stimuli are presented in a by-dimension format. In the current study, we presented participants with a series of apartment choice sets designed to elicit the similarity eﬀect, with either a by-alternative or by-dimension presentation format. Participants in the by-alternative condition demonstrated a standard similarity eﬀect; however, participants in the by-dimension condition demonstrated a strong reverse similarity eﬀect. The present data can be accounted for by Multialternative Decision Field Theory (MDFT) and the Multiattribute Linear Ballistic Accumulator (MLBA), but not Elimination by Aspects (EBA). Indeed, when some weak assumptions of within-dimension processes are met, MDFT and the MLBA predict the reverse similarity eﬀect. These modeling results suggest that the similarity eﬀect is governed by either forgetting and inhibition (MDFT), or attention to positive or negative diﬀerences (MLBA). These results demonstrate that ﬂexibility in the comparison process needs to be incorporated into theories of preferential choice.},

Models that account for context effects typically assume a within-dimension comparison process; however, the presentation format of a choice set can influence comparison strategies. The present study jointly tests the influence of presentation format on the attraction, compromise, and similarity effects in a within-subjects design. Participants completed a series of choices designed to elicit each of the three context effects, with either a by-alternative or by-dimension format. Whereas the by-alternative format elicited a standard similarity effect, but null attraction and reverse compromise effects, the by-dimension format elicited standard attraction and compromise effects, but a reverse similarity effect. These novel results are supported by a re-analysis of the eye-tracking data collected by Noguchi and Stewart (Cognition, 132(1), 44–56, 2014) and demonstrate that flexibility in the comparison process should be incorporated into theories of preferential choice.},

	abstract = {Research on reference points highlights how alternatives outside the choice set can alter the perceived value of available alternatives, arguably framing the choice scenario. The present work utilizes reference points to study the effects of framing in preferential choice, using the similarity and attraction context effects as performance measures. We specifically test the predictions of Multialternative Decision by Sampling (MDbS; Noguchi \& Stewart, 2018), a recent preferential choice model that can account for both reference points and context effects. In Experiment 1, consistent with predictions by MDbS, we find a standard similarity effect when no reference point is given that increases when both dimensions are framed negatively and decreases when both dimensions are framed positively. Contrary to predictions by MDbS, when the two dimensions are framed as tradeoffs, participants prefer whichever alternative performs best in the negatively framed dimension. Performance of MDbS was improved by the addition of a frame-based global attention allocation mechanism. Experiment 2 extends these results to a “by-dimension” presentation format in an attempt to bring participant behavior in line with MDbS assumptions. The empirical and modeling results replicated those of Experiment 1. Experiment 3 used the attraction effect to test the effects of framing when the best-performing alternative on each dimension was identical across target conditions, therefore reducing the potential effects of a global attention allocation mechanism. The effects of framing were indeed greatly reduced, and the performance of MDbS was markedly improved. The results extend framing to the context effects literature, provide new benchmarks for models and theories of context effects, and point to the need for a global attention mechanism.},

	abstract = {Context effects constitute benchmark behavioral phenomena for theories of choice. Previous research using signal-to-respond paradigms suggests that these phenomena develop differentially over time. Importantly, however, such time pressure manipulations correspond to an externally controlled stopping rule, which may produce different behavior compared to an internally controlled stopping rule. The first goal of this work was to examine context effects as a function of internally controlled response time. Across eight data sets, we find a consistent crossover pattern such that the attraction and compromise effects are associated with slower response times and the similarity effect is associated with faster response times. The second goal is to utilize state-ofthe-art methodology (Evans et al. in Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 26, 1–33, 2019; Turner and Sederberg in Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 21(2), 227–250, 2014) to determine whether four information-accumulation models (MDFT, the LCA, the AAM, and the MLBA) can correctly capture the direction in which preference evolves over time in each context when fit to joint choice and response time data with an internal stopping rule. Whereas the MLBA best fit the means, and MDFT and the AAM partially captured the qualitative patterns, none of the models captured the full spectrum of results. Despite a strong historical trend for empirical work in consumer choice, recent response time modeling has focused on fundamentally different nonconsumer tasks. The third goal is to generalize that modeling to the consumer choice domain, providing a bridge to a wide range of prior work. The present work provides new insights into the relationship between choice and response times and sets important constraints for models that seek to account for such behavior.},

	abstract = {The ﬁrst aim of this research is to compare computational models of multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice when attribute values are explicit. The choice predictions of utility (standard random utility \& weighted valuation), heuristic (elimination-by-aspects, lexicographic, \& maximum attribute value), and dynamic (multi-alternative decision ﬁeld theory, MDFT, \& a version of the multi-attribute linear ballistic accumulator, MLBA) models are contrasted on both preferential and risky choice data. Using both maximum likelihood and cross-validation ﬁt measures on choice data, the utility and dynamic models are preferred over the heuristic models for risky choice, with a slight overall advantage for the MLBA for preferential choice. The response time predictions of these models (except the MDFT) are then tested. Although the MLBA accurately predicts response time distributions, it only weakly accounts for stimulus-level differences. The other models completely fail to account for stimulus-level differences. Process tracing measures, i.e., eye and mouse tracking, were also collected. None of the qualitative predictions of the models are completely supported by that data. These results suggest that the models may not appropriately represent the interaction of attention and preference formation. To overcome this potential shortcoming, the second aim of this research is to test preference-formation assumptions, independently of attention, by developing the models of attentional sampling (MAS) model family which incorporates the empirical gaze patterns into a sequential sampling framework. An MAS variant that includes attribute values, but only updates the currently viewed alternative and does not contrast values across alternatives, performs well in both experiments. Overall, the results support the dynamic models, but point to the need to incorporate a framework that more accurately reﬂects the relationship between attention and the preference-formation process.},

The potentially complex decision strategies underlying such consumer decisions have recently been investigated in detail, with most researchers restricting their focus to a relatively small subset of heuristics so as to retain tractability in analyses and identifiability of parameterized cognitive models. Many of these heuristics can be conceived as special cases of a smaller number of overarching dimensions: processing all or a subset of the attribute information describing the consumer options, and processing that attribute information in series or in parallel. These higher-level dimensions correspond to two latent factors of focus in Systems Factorial Technology (SFT), a non-parametric modeling technique that aims to uncover the mental architectures that generate observed decision behavior. Here, we develop a simplified consumer decision scenario and report proof-of-concept evidence regarding the ability of SFT to discriminate between mental architectures, and as a consequence whole classes of decision strategies, in the newly developed consumer task. Our results suggest that most people make decisions prior to processing all available product information. Furthermore, people appear to process numerically presented attribute information in serial, and pictorially presented attribute information in parallel. This extension of SFT beyond its classic domain of application in perceptual processing provides a relatively simple, non-parametric approach to investigating consumer decision strategies.},

Since visualizations can be used to support decision making — e.g., when choosing a house to buy or an employee to hire —a systematic bias could have important implications. In a ﬁrst crowdsource experiment, we indeed partially replicated the attraction effect with three alternatives presented as a numerical table, and observed similar effects when they were presented as a scatterplot. In a second experiment, we investigated if the effect extends to larger sets of alternatives, where the number of alternatives is too large for numerical tables to be practical.

            Imagine you are deciding between two goods: A is simple but inexpensive, B is luxurious but more costly. Introducing a less advantageous option (e.g., lower quality than A, same price) should not alter your choice between A and B. However, this principle is often violated; three classic biases known as “decoy effects” have been identified, each describing a stereotyped choice pattern in the presence of irrelevant information. Through behavioral testing in human participants and computer simulations, we show that these decoy effects are special cases of a wider principle, whereby stimulus value information is encoded in a relative, rather than an absolute, format. This work clarifies the origin of three behavioral phenomena that are widely studied in psychology and economics.
          , 
            Human decisions can be biased by irrelevant information. For example, choices between two preferred alternatives can be swayed by a third option that is inferior or unavailable. Previous work has identified three classic biases, known as the attraction, similarity, and compromise effects, which arise during choices between economic alternatives defined by two attributes. However, the reliability, interrelationship, and computational origin of these three biases have been controversial. Here, a large cohort of human participants made incentive-compatible choices among assets that varied in price and quality. Instead of focusing on the three classic effects, we sampled decoy stimuli exhaustively across bidimensional multiattribute space and constructed a full map of decoy influence on choices between two otherwise preferred target items. Our analysis reveals that the decoy influence map is highly structured even beyond the three classic biases. We identify a very simple model that can fully reproduce the decoy influence map and capture its variability in individual participants. This model reveals that the three decoy effects are not distinct phenomena but are all special cases of a more general principle, by which attribute values are repulsed away from the context provided by rival options. The model helps us understand why the biases are typically correlated across participants and allows us to validate a prediction about their interrelationship. This work helps to clarify the origin of three of the most widely studied biases in human decision-making.},

Perceptual decisions are considered to be at a non–deliberative cognitive level and have an outside criterion that defines the quality of decisions. Preferential decisions are considered to be at a higher cognitive level and the quality of decisions depend on the decision maker’s subjective goals. Besides these crucial differences, both types of decisions also have in common that uncertain information about the choice situation has to be processed before a decision can be made. The present work aims to acknowledge the commonalities of both types of decision making to lay bare the crucial differences. For this aim we examine perceptual and preferential decisions with a novel choice paradigm that uses the identical stimulus material for both types of decisions. This paradigm allows us to model the decisions and response times of both types of decisions with the same sequential sampling model, the drift diffusion model. The results illustrate that the different incentive structure in both types of tasks changes people’s behavior so that they process information more efficiently and respond more cautiously in the perceptual as compared to the preferential task. These findings set out a perspective for further integration of perceptual and preferential decision making in a single ramework.},

Prior investigations in this domain have relied primarily on choice data to compare different theories. Despite numerous such studies, results have largely been inconclusive. Our study uses state-of-the-art response-time modeling and data from 12 different experiments appearing in six different published studies to compare four previously proposed theories/models of these effects: multi-alternative decision field theory (MDFT), the leaky-competing accumulator (LCA), the multi-attribute linear ballistic accumulator (MLBA), and the associative accumulation model (AAM). All four models are, by design, dynamic process models and thus a comprehensive evaluation of their theoretical properties requires quantitative evaluation with both choice and response-time data. Our results show that response-time data is critical at distinguishing among these models and that using choice data alone can lead to inconclusive results for some datasets. In conclusion, we encourage future research to include response-time data in the evaluation of these models.},

	abstract = {Evidence accumulation models have been one of the most dominant modeling frameworks used to study rapid decisionmaking over the past several decades. These models propose that evidence accumulates from the environment until the evidence for one alternative reaches some threshold, typically associated with caution, triggering a response. However, researchers have recently begun to reconsider the fundamental assumptions of how caution varies with time. In the past, it was typically assumed that levels of caution are independent of time. Recent investigations have however suggested the possibility that levels of caution decrease over time and that this strategy provides more efficient performance under certain conditions. Our study provides the first comprehensive assessment of this newer class of models accounting for time-varying caution to determine how robustly their parameters can be estimated. We assess five overall variants of collapsing threshold/urgency signal models based on the diffusion decision model, linear ballistic accumulator model, and urgency gating model frameworks. We find that estimation of parameters, particularly those associated with caution/urgency modulation are most robust for the linearly collapsing threshold diffusion model followed by an urgency-gating model with a leakage process. All other models considered, particularly those with ballistic accumulation or nonlinear thresholds, are unable to recover their own parameters adequately, making their usage in parameter estimation contexts questionable.},

	abstract = {One of the most interesting ﬁndings in multialternative, multiattribute choice is the occurrence of “context effects,” where the relative preference between two alternatives is inﬂuenced by a third, decoy alternative. Although context effects have been well documented, the circumstances necessary for them to occur is a puzzle. Sometimes, the effects disappear or reverse, suggesting they are fragile. We hypothesize this fragility is partly due to a sequential comparison process where subsets of options are compared and evaluated during deliberation. Thus, manipulating the comparison of options (by manipulating presentation order of options) should inﬂuence the manifestation of these effect. We test this hypothesis in two ways for the attraction effect. First, we develop a temporally sequential version of a well-established perceptual context effects paradigm, where participants only see 1 alternative at a time. Results show that presentation order strongly inﬂuences choices. In some orders, a standard attraction effect occurs and in others, a reversal (or “repulsion”) effect occurs. A piecewise extension of the Multiattribute Linear Ballistic Accumulator model explains our results by showing how forgetting (due to the sequential presentation) inﬂuences the comparison of options. Quantitative ﬁtting demonstrates that the model explains well the data, outperforming alternative heuristic models. Second, we reanalyze attraction effect data from Trueblood et al. (2015) where the spatial order of options was manipulated. Similar to the sequential task, results show a complex pattern of attraction and repulsion effects. Taken together, these results indicate that a malleable comparison process contributes to the fragility of context effects.},

For over 30 years, this simple demonstration of context dependence has been taken as strong evidence against a class of parsimonious value-maximising models that evaluate alternatives independently from one another. Signiﬁcantly, however, in previous demonstrations of the attraction effect alternatives are approximately equally valuable, so there was little consequence to the decision maker irrespective of which alternative was selected. Here we vary the difference in expected value between alternatives and provide the ﬁrst demonstration that, although extinguished with large differences, this theoretically important effect persists when choice between alternatives has a consequence. We use this result to clarify the implications of the attraction effect, arguing that although it robustly violates the assumptions of value-maximising models, it does not eliminate the possibility that human decision making is optimal. © 2016 The Authors Journal of Behavioral Decision Making Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

We then review research into two potential sources of behavioral heterogeneity: individual differences in decision-making competence and developmental changes across the life span. Next, we illustrate applications intended to improve individual and organizational decision making in health, public policy, intelligence analysis, and risk management.

Using an eyetracking experiment, I ﬁnd the baDDM makes accurate quantitative predictions about several key variables including choices, reaction times, and how these variables are correlated with attention to two attributes in an accept-reject decision. Furthermore, I estimate an attribute-based ﬁxation bias that suggests attention to an attribute increases its subjective weight by 5\%, while the unattended attribute’s weight is decreased by 10\%.},

Such effects do not typically occur when consumers experience the product (e.g., taste a drink) or when even one of the product attributes is represented perceptually (e.g., differently priced hotel rooms whose quality is depicted with a photo). The authors posit that perceptual representations of attributes do not support the sorts of comparisons that drive the attraction effect with highly stylized examples, and they question the practical significance of the effect.},

Third, we critically evaluate the multiple-strategy approach to decision making.

	abstract = {Humans and other animals often violate economic principles when choosing between multiple alternatives, but the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain elusive. A robust finding is that adding a third option can alter the relative preference for the original alternatives, but studies disagree on whether the third option’s value decreases or increases accuracy. To shed light on this controversy, we used and extended the paradigm of one study reporting a positive effect. However, our four experiments with 147 human participants and a reanalysis of the original data revealed that the positive effect is neither replicable nor reproducible. In contrast, our behavioral and eye-tracking results are best explained by assuming that the third option’s value captures attention and thereby impedes accuracy. We propose a computational model that accounts for the complex interplay of value, attention, and choice. Our theory explains how choice sets and environments influence the neurocognitive processes of multi-alternative decision making.
          , 
            A man in a restaurant is offered a choice between apple or blueberry pie, and chooses apple. The waiter then returns a few moments later and tells him they also have cherry pie available. “In that case”, replies the man, “I’ll have blueberry”.
            This well-known anecdote illustrates a principle in economics and psychology called the independence principle. This states that preferences between two options should not change when a third option becomes available. A person who prefers apple over blueberry pie should continue to do so regardless of whether cherry pie is also on the menu. But, as in the anecdote, people often violate the independence principle when making decisions. One example is voting. People may vote for a candidate who would not usually be their first choice only because there is also a similar but clearly less preferable candidate available.
            Such behavior provides clues to the mechanisms behind making decisions. Studies show, for example, that when people have to choose between two options, introducing a desirable third option that cannot be selected – a distractor – alters what decision they make. But the studies disagree on whether the distractor improves or impairs performance.
            Gluth et al. now resolve this controversy using tasks in which people had to choose between rectangles on a computer screen for the chance to win different amounts of money. Contrary to a previous study, their four experiments showed that a high-value distractor did not change how likely the volunteers were to select one of the two available options over the other. Instead, the distractor slowed down the entire decision-making process. Moreover, volunteers often selected the high-value distractor despite knowing that they could not have it. One explanation for such behavior is that high-value items capture our attention automatically even when they are irrelevant to our goals. If a person likes chocolate cake, their attention will immediately be drawn to a cake in a shop window, even if they had no plans to buy a cake. Eye-tracking data confirmed that volunteers in the above experiments spent more time looking at high-value items than low-value ones. Those volunteers whose gaze was distracted the most by high-value items also made the worst decisions.
            Based on the new data, Gluth et al. developed and tested a mathematical model. The model describes how we make decisions, and how attention influences this process. It provides insights into the interplay between attention, valuation and choice – particularly when we make decisions under time pressure. Such insights may enable us to improve decision-making environments where people must choose quickly between many options. These include emergency medicine, road traffic situations, and the stock market. To achieve this goal, findings from the current study need to be tested under more naturalistic conditions.},

The methodology takes into consideration (1) high degrees of external validity (economic consequences, binding choices, no choice options, and real brands), and (2) the analysis of the attraction effect in mid-involvement categories, which have received very little attention.

However, in many real-life decisions, such as the choice of a preferred grocer, people decide based on their past experience with the options' attributes (e.g., the frequency and magnitude of product discounts over time). We examine whether the attraction effect extends from description-based to experience-based choice between gambles. Our results demonstrate that the attraction effect exists but is less prevalent in experience-based than in descriptionbased choice. This is because the dominance relationship, necessary for the attraction effect to occur, is more difﬁcult to recognize in experience-based choice. Yet, when dominance is recognized, people may use it to guide difﬁcult trade-off choices. We discuss practical implications. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We extend a well-established cognitive model, which has successfully explained both choices and response times for simple decision tasks, to complex, multi-attribute discrete choice data. The ﬁts, and parameters, of the extended model for two sets of choice data (involving patient preferences for dermatology appointments, and consumer attitudes toward mobile phones) agree with those of standard choice models. The extended model also accounts for choice and response time data in a perceptual judgment task designed in a manner analogous to best–worst discrete choice experiments.

We examined best and worst choices using discrete choice tasks, in which participants selected either the best option from a set, the worst option, or selected both the best and the worst options. One experiment used perceptual judgments of area, and another used consumer preferences for various attributes of mobile phones. In both domains, we found that the task (best, worst, or best and worst) does not alter the preferences expressed for the best (respectively, the worst) option. We also observed that the choice probabilities were consistent with a single latent dimension— options that were frequently selected as best were infrequently selected as worst, and vice versa— both within and between respondents. A quantitative model of choice and response time provided convergent evidence on those relations, with model variants that assumed an inverse relationship between the estimated parameters for best and worst choices accounting well for the data. We conclude that the diverse types of best and worst choices that we studied can be conceived as opposing ends of a single continuous dimension rather than distinct latent entities. We discuss these results in the light of rather different results for accepting (e.g., purchasing) and rejecting (e.g., not purchasing) options from a set.},

	abstract = {Decision models are essential theoretical tools in the study of choice behavior, but there is little consensus about the best model for describing choice, with different fields and different research programs favoring their own idiosyncratic sets of models. Even within a given field, decision models are seldom studied alongside each other, and insights obtained using 1 model are not typically generalized to others. We present the results of a large-scale computational analysis that uses landscaping techniques to generate a representational structure for describing decision models. Our analysis includes 89 prominent models of risky and intertemporal choice, and results in an ontology of decision models, interpretable in terms of model spaces, clusters, hierarchies, and graphs. We use this ontology to measure the properties of individual models and quantify the relationships between different models. Our results show how decades of quantitative research on human choice behavior can be synthesized within a single representational framework.},

Introducing a decoy increases the popularity of a target option and decreases the popularity of a competitor. This phenomenon contradicts standard economic models of individual choice which assume preferences to be independent of irrelevant alternatives. Decoy effects include a set of phenomena in which particular types of decoys have been observed to influence choice. This paper focuses on two effects: the asymmetric domination and compromise effect. Earlier studies on decoy effects have concentrated on consumer choice. The aim of this paper is to investigate the possibility of observing the same effects in a political context. This question is studied by presenting choice problems over various policy issues to a group of respondents. The results show that the outcomes of a political decision making process can be affected by alternatives which should be irrelevant according to the standard approach. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Yet, it is still commonly held that preferences for individual items are maintained, such as caching a separate value estimate for each experienced option. Instead, we propose that all possible choice options and preferences are represented in a shared, continuous, multidimensional space that supports generalization. Decision making is cast as a learning process that seeks to align choices and preferences to maintain coherency. We formalized an error-driven learning model that updates preferences to align with past choices, which makes repeating those and related choices more likely in the future. The model correctly predicts that making a free choice increases preferences along related attributes. For example, after choosing a political candidate based on trivial information (e.g., they like cats), voters' views on abortion, immigration, and trade subsequently shifted to match their chosen candidate.},

In contrast, we demonstrate that if a person is only able to make noisy calculations of expected value and noisy observations of the ordinal relations among option features, then the expected value maximizing choice is influenced by the addition of new options and does give rise to apparent preference reversals. We explore the implications of expected value maximizing choice, conditioned on noisy observations, for a range of contextual preference reversal types—including attraction, compromise, similarity, and phantom effects. These preference reversal types have played a key role in the development of models of human choice. We conclude that experiments demonstrating contextual preference reversals are not evidence for irrationality.

For instance, both perceptual and value-based choices are highly influenced by the context in which the choices are made. However, the mechanisms which allow context to influence our choice process as well as the extent of the similarity between the perceptual and preferential processes are still unclear. In this study, we examine a within-subject relation between the attraction effect, which is a well-known effect of context on preferential choice, and the Gestalt law of proximity. Then, we aim to use this link to better understand the mechanisms underlying the attraction effect. We conducted one study followed by an additional pre-registered replication study, where subjects performed a Gestalt-psychophysical task and a decoy task. Comparing the behavioral sensitivity of each subject in both tasks, we found that the more susceptible a subject is to the proximity law, the more she displayed the attraction effect. These results demonstrate a within-subject relation between a perceptual phenomenon (proximity law) and a value-based bias (attraction effect) which further strengthens the notion of common rules between perceptual and value-based processing. Moreover, this suggests that the mechanism underlying the attraction effect is related to grouping by proximity with attention as a mediator.},

Previous attempts to explain these reversals have relied on allowing utility of the options to change across elicitation methods by changing the decision weights, the attribute values, or the combination of this information—still, no theory has successfully accounted for all the phenomena. In this article, the authors present a new computational model that accounts for the empirical trends without changing decision weights, values, or combination rules. Rather, the current model specifies a dynamic evaluation and response process that correctly predicts preference orderings across 6 elicitation methods, retains stable evaluations across methods, and makes novel predictions regarding response distributions and response times.},

	abstract = {A key component of most decision making theories is the decision weight that reﬂects the importance of consequences when evaluating an action. In algebraic models such as prospect theory or conﬁgural weight theories, these are explicit value multipliers with functional forms ﬁt to empirical data. In process models such as decision ﬁeld theory, elimination-by-aspects, or decision-by-sampling, they represent the distribution of attention about which simplifying assumptions are often made. Still, little is known about the cognitive processes that produce these weights. The current work presents a computational model that derives decision weights from elementary attention processing mechanisms. The basic idea is that a decision weight corresponds to the proportion of times an outcome is predicted to occur when an action is mentally simulated. We demonstrate the model’s success by (a) coherently explaining several robust phenomena with a single set of parameters, including some that utility theories cannot; (b) ﬁtting common functional forms used in algebraic models such as prospect theory, allowing for cognitive processing reinterpretations of their parameters; and (c) quantitatively ﬁtting the model to extensive data sets on choice and pricing.},

In this paper, we explore a novel factor that has received only little attention: the composition of the choice set. Drawing on prior research on the attraction effect of decoys in consumer choice and personnel decisions, we posit that when decision makers need to decide whether to hire a male or a female applicant for a stereotypically male position, the presence of a third applicant whose profile is asymmetrically dominated by one of the two applicants can in many circumstances strongly increase the odds that the male applicant will be selected, but will not be beneficial for the female applicant. We test our hypotheses in five experimental studies with different designs, experimental settings, and participant pools—including managers with professional experience in hiring decisions. Our results provide robust evidence demonstrating the strong effects of choice set composition on the emergence of gender bias. In addition, we found that the presence of asymmetrically dominated applicants makes decision makers more confident in their biased decisions and more likely to implement them immediately without searching for further information. Finally, our results also provide some initial evidence that our results for stereotypically male positions will be reversed when hiring decisions are made for stereotypically female positions where the presence of decoys instead gives an advantage to female over male applicants.},

We propose an explanation based on the idea that small differences draw more attention than identical attributes do and that people’s perceptions of similarity involve averaging attributes that are salient. We provide evidence that introducing small differences between objects increases perceived similarity. We also show that an increase in similarity decreases the difficulty of choice and the likelihood that a choice will be deferred.},

Although it has long been recognized that most purchase decisions are made with incomplete information, researchers still know little about the effect of missing information on consumer choice. Building on prior work by Slovic and MacPhillamy (1974) , the authors demonstrate that a tendency to give more weight to attributes on which all considered options have values (common attributes), compared with attributes for which not all options have values (unique attributes), can often lead to intransitive preferences. Using process measures, the authors further show that buyers tend to interpret missing attribute values in a way that supports the purchase of the option that is superior on the common attribute. The results indicate that information presentation format and inferences about missing values cannot account for the observed effects of missing information on consumer choice. The authors also show that the purchase decisions of buyers who consider attribute importance before making a choice and those with high need for cognition are less susceptible to influence by missing information. Finally, the findings indicate that choosing from sets with missing information can affect buyer tastes and purchase decisions made subsequently. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this research.},

However, the computational processes used to make choices in more complicated situations involving three or more options are unknown. We propose a model of trinary value-based choice that generalizes what is known about binary choice, and test it using an eye-tracking experiment. We find that the model provides a quantitatively accurate description of the relationship between choice, reaction time, and visual fixation data using the same parameters that were estimated in previous work on binary choice. Our findings suggest that the brain uses similar computational processes to make binary and trinary choices.},

	abstract = {Theories that describe how people assign prices and make choices are typically based on the idea that both of these responses are derived from a common static, deterministic function used to assign utilities to options. However, preference reversals—where prices assigned to gambles conflict with preference orders elicited through binary choices—indicate that the response processes underlying these different methods of evaluation are more intricate. We address this issue by formulating a new computational model that assumes an initial bias or anchor that depends on type of price task (buying, selling, or certainty equivalents) and a stochastic evaluation accumulation process that depends on gamble attributes. To test this new model, we investigated choices and prices for a wide range of gambles and price tasks, including pricing under time pressure. In line with model predictions, we found that price distributions possessed stark skew that depended on the type of price and the attributes of gambles being considered. Prices were also sensitive to time pressure, indicating a dynamic evaluation process underlying price generation. The model out-performed prospect theory in predicting prices and additionally predicted the response times associated with these prices, which no prior model has accomplished. Finally, we show that the model successfully predicts out-of-sample choices and that its parameters allow us to fit choice response times as well. This price accumulation model therefore provides a superior account of the distributional and dynamic properties of price, leveraging process-level mechanisms to provide a more complete account of the valuation processes common across multiple methods of eliciting preference.},

Recent studies challenged the robustness of attraction effect by manipulating the distance between decoy and target in perceptual decision-making tasks. However, previous manipulation of the distance was not comprehensive and systematic enough. Whether the influence of distance between decoy and target on attraction effect would occur in high-level decisions remains unclear. The present study conducted five experiments (two on perceptual decisions and three on preferential decisions) where the distance of the decoy to the target option was systematically manipulated. We found that the distance of the decoy to the target systematically changes the strength and the direction of the attraction effect and sometimes causes its opposite: repulsion effect. Specifically, such change of the context effect (from attraction to repulsion) follows a U-shape function (technically regarding the relative choice share of the target option [RST] as a function of the target–decoy distance), which is in the shape of convex in the perceptual decisions but concave in the domain of preferential decisions. Our findings show how the distance of decoy to target influences the robustness of attraction effect in preferential and perceptual decisions.},

Studies examining this risk-sensitive decision making, however, typically ask people directly what they would do in hypothetical choice scenarios. A recent flurry of studies has shown that when these risky decisions include rare outcomes, people make different choices for explicitly described probabilities than for experienced probabilistic outcomes. Specifically, rare outcomes are overweighted when described and underweighted when experienced. In two experiments, we examined risk-sensitive decision making when the risky option had two equally probable (50\%) outcomes. For experience-based decisions, there was a reversal of the reflection effect with greater risk seeking for gains than for losses, as compared to description-based decisions. This fundamental difference in experienced and described choices cannot be explained by the weighting of rare events and suggests a separate subjective utility curve for experience.},

	abstract = {Many important decisions that consumers face involve choosing between options that are unattractive or undesirable—the proverbial “lesser of two evils.” Consumers, who face budget or geographical constraints, for example, end up with mostly undesirable consideration sets; yet a choice is necessary. We examine the role of option set desirability in the context of the well-established attraction effect. In ﬁve studies, we show that the attraction effect occurs in desirable domains but is eliminated when all the options are undesirable (Experiments 1–4). We further ﬁnd that this asymmetric effect is consistent with a shift in decision makers' processing styles. Decision makers show more vigilant processing when making choices among undesirable (vs. desirable) domains (Experiments 3A and 3B), which results in an attenuated attraction effect (Experiment 4). Our results indicate that the attraction effect might not be as robust as generally thought and establishes (un)desirability as an important boundary condition.},

	abstract = {The maximizing tendency denotes individuals' predisposition to look for the best option rather than settling for something that passes an internal threshold of acceptability. This research examines how maximizing affects the compromise effect: the preference for an option with relatively intermediate attribute values. Results show that maximizers attempt to maximize gains on all attributes (rather than to rely on a single, most important attribute as satisﬁcers do) and make more compensatory tradeoffs, which leads to more often choosing a compromise option (Studies 2 \& 3). Results held whether maximization was measured as an individual difference variable (Studies 1 \& 2) or activated as a decision mindset (Study 3). When asked to make decisions for a (ﬁctional) prototypical maximizer, however, people intuited fewer compromise choices (Study 4). This article concludes by discussing relevant theories on cognitive capacity, regulatory focus, and choice context effects, and by offering tangible suggestions for follow-up research. © 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology.

	abstract = {The attraction eﬀect emerges when adding a seemingly irrelevant option (decoy) to a binary choice shifts preference towards a target option. This suggests that choice behaviour is dynamic, i.e., choice values are developed during deliberation, rather than manifesting some pre-existing preference set. Whereas several models of multialternative and multiattribute decision making consider dynamic choice processes as crucial to explain the attraction eﬀect, empirically investigating the exact nature of such processes requires complementing choice output with other data. In this study, we focused on asymmetrically dominated decoys (i.e., decoys that are clearly dominated only by the target option) to examine the attentional and comparative processes responsible for the attraction eﬀect. Through an eye-tracker paradigm, we showed that the decoy option can aﬀect subjects’ preferences in two diﬀerent and not mutually exclusive ways: by focusing the attention on the salient option and the dominance attribute, and by increasing comparisons with the choice dominant pattern. Although conceptually and procedurally distinct, both pathways for decoy eﬀects produce an increase in preferences for the target option, in line with attentional and dynamic models of decision making. Eye-tracking data provide further details to the veriﬁcation of such models, by highlighting the context-dependent nature of attention and the development of similarity-driven competitive decisional processes.},

	abstract = {Context effects are phenomena of multiattribute, multialternative decision-making that contradict normative models of preference. Numerous computational models have been created to explain these effects, communicated through the estimation of model parameters. Historically, parameters have been estimated by ﬁtting these models to choice response data alone. In other contexts, such as those conventionally studied in perceptual decision-making, the times associated with choice responses have proven effective in improving understanding and testing competing theoretical accounts of various experimental manipulations. Here, we explore the advantages of incorporating response time distributions into the inference procedure, using the most recent model of context effects—the multiattribute linear ballistic accumulator (MLBA) model—as a case study. First, we establish in a simulation study that incorporating response time data in the inference procedure does indeed produce more constrained estimates of the model parameters, and the extent of this constraint is modulated by the number of observations within the data. Second, we generalize our results beyond the MLBA model by using likelihood-free techniques to estimate model parameters. Finally, we investigate parameter differences when choice or choice response time data are used to ﬁt the MLBA model by ﬁtting different model variants to real data from a perceptual decision-making experiment with context effects. Based on likelihood-free and likelihood-based estimations of both simulated and real data, we conclude that response time measures offer an important source of constraint for models of context effects.},

In MDbS, the evidence accumulated is outcomes of pairwise ordinal comparisons between attribute values. MDbS provides a quantitative account of the attraction, compromise, and similarity effects equal to that of other models, and captures a wider range of empirical phenomena than other models.},

Decoy effects are documented widely within the human consumer choice literature, and even extend to preference testing within nonhuman animals. Here, we extended this line of research to a perceptual discrimination task with rhesus monkeys to determine whether decoy stimuli would impact size judgments of rectangular stimuli. In a computerized task, monkeys attempted to choose the larger of two rectangles that varied in size and orientation (horizontally or vertically oriented). In probe trials, a third stimulus (the decoy) was presented that was smaller than the other two rectangles but matched the orientation of one of them. On half of the probe trials, the presented decoy matched the orientation of the larger stimulus, and on the other half, the decoy matched the orientation of the smaller stimulus. Monkeys rarely selected the decoy stimulus. However, their performance (selection of the largest rectangle) increased relative to the baseline trials (with only two choices) when the decoy was congruent in its orientation with the largest rectangle, but decreased relative to baseline when the decoy was incongruent with the largest rectangle. Thus, a decoy stimulus impacted monkeys’ perceptual choice behavior even when it was not a viable choice option itself. These results are explained with regard to comparative evaluation mechanisms.},

We examine effort and accuracy and their role in strategy selection. Several strategies that may be used to make choices under risk are simulated using a production system framework. This framework allows the estimation of the effort required to use the strategy in a choice environment, while simultaneously measuring its accuracy relative to a normative model. A series of Monte-Carlo studies varied several aspects of the choice environments, including the complexity of the task and the presence or absence of dominated alternatives. These simulations identify strategies which approximate the accuracy of normative procedures while requiring substantially less effort. These results, however, are highly contingent upon characteristics of the task environment. The potential of production system models in understanding task effects in decisions is stressed.},

In Experiment 1, participants were presented trinary choice sets, with half of the sets containing a phantom decoy in one of ﬁve possible locations within the attribute space. Phantom decoy effects were robust across all decoy locations but one, and the pattern of effects most closely corresponded to predictions of the relative advantage model. Experiment 2 used a within-subjects manipulation of the ﬁve phantom decoy locations.

Why would small samples be used, and which experiences are likely to be included in these samples? Previous studies suggest that a cognitively efficient reliance on the most recent experiences can be very effective. We explore a very different and more cognitively demanding process explaining the tendency to rely on small samples: exploitation of environmental regularities. The first part of our study shows that across wide classes of dynamic binary choice environments, focusing only on experiences that followed the same sequence of outcomes preceding the current task is more effective than focusing on the most recent experiences. The second part of our study examines the psychological significance of these sequence-based rules. It shows that these tractable rules reproduce well-known indications of sensitivity to sequences and predict a nontrivial wavy recency effect of rare events. Analysis of published data supports this wavy recency prediction, but suggests an even wavier effect than these sequence-based rules predict. This pattern, and the main behavioral phenomena documented in basic decisions from experience and probability learning tasks, can be captured with a similarity-based model assuming that people follow sequences of outcomes most of the time but sometimes respond to trends. We conclude with theoretical notes on similarity-based learning.},

	abstract = {Consumers’ choices are typically influenced by the choice context in ways that standard models cannot explain. We provide a concise explanation of the attraction, compromise and similarity effects. The model, Multi-Attribute Decision by Sampling (MADS), posits that the evaluation of a choice option is based on its relative position in the market distribution as first inferred and then sampled by the decision-maker. The inferred market distribution is assumed to be systematically influenced by the choice options. The value of a choice option is assumed to be determined by the number of sampled comparators that the option dominates. We specify conditions on the sampling distribution that are sufficient for MADS to predict the three context effects. We tested the model using a novel experimental design with 1200 online participants. In the first experiment, prior to making a choice participants were shown a selection of market options designed to change their beliefs about the market distribution. Participants’ subsequent choices were affected as predicted. The effect was strong enough to impact the size of two of the three classic context effects significantly. In the second experiment, we elicited individuals’ estimates of distributions of market options and found the estimates to be systematically influenced by the choice set as predicted by the model. It is concluded that MADS, a model based on simple binary ordinal comparisons, is sufficient to account for the three classic context effects.},

Accordingly, it is not surprising that the AD effect is often not observed when other choice drivers have greater impact and/or when the AD configuration is unlikely to be perceived. However, when price is an attribute (and in many other cases), the AD effect is often observed in both properly designed studies and the real world. The author notes that Frederick, Lee, and Baskin (2014) raise important questions, but they would have made a greater contribution had they (1) systematically studied the drivers of AD perceptions, (2) more accurately tried to replicate previous AD effect demonstrations, and (3) systematically studied the repulsion effect. The author also briefly comments on the Yang and Lynn (2014) studies, which he asserts did not test the AD effect properly in most cases.},

	abstract = {Most utility theories of choice assume that the introduction of an irrelevant option (called the decoy) to a choice set does not change the preference between existing options. On the contrary, a wealth of behavioral data demonstrates the dependence of preference on the decoy and on the context in which the options are presented. Nevertheless, neural mechanisms underlying context-dependent preference are poorly understood. In order to shed light on these mechanisms, we design and perform a novel experiment to measure within-subject decoy effects. We find within-subject decoy effects similar to what have been shown previously with between-subject designs. More importantly, we find that not only are the decoy effects correlated, pointing to similar underlying mechanisms, but also these effects increase with the distance of the decoy from the original options. To explain these observations, we construct a plausible neuronal model that can account for decoy effects based on the trial-by-trial adjustment of neural representations to the set of available options. This adjustment mechanism, which we call range normalization, occurs when the nervous system is required to represent different stimuli distinguishably, while being limited to using bounded neural activity. The proposed model captures our experimental observations and makes new predictions about the influence of the choice set size on the decoy effects, which are in contrast to previous models of context-dependent choice preference. Critically, unlike previous psychological models, the computational resource required by our range-normalization model does not increase exponentially as the set size increases. Our results show that context-dependent choice behavior, which is commonly perceived as an irrational response to the presence of irrelevant options, could be a natural consequence of the biophysical limits of neural representation in the brain.},

	abstract = {Traditional theories of decision making require that humans evaluate choice options independently of each other. The independence principle underlying this notion states that the relative choice probability of two options should be independent of the choice set. Previous research demonstrated systematic violations of this principle in decisions from description (context effects), leading to the development of various models explaining them. Yet, the cognitive processes underlying multi-alternative decisions from experience remain unclear. Furthermore, it is not known whether context effects also occur in such decisions, and existing learning models do not predict them. In three experiments, the similarity effect, compromise effect, and attraction effect were explored in a 3-armed bandit task with full feedback. Participants’ behavior systematically violated the independence principle, although mostly not in line with past context-effect patterns in decisions from description. The observed similarity effect and the reversals of the compromise and the attraction effects can be explained by a similarity mechanism, according to which options with similar outcomes appear less attractive. We propose the accentuationof-differences model that relies on this mechanism. We further validated the model in a fourth experiment in which we demonstrated a new violation of independence, the accentuation effect. Across all experiments, the model outperformed traditional reinforcement-learning models in describing the observed findings. Finally, the model’s generalizability was confirmed using the Iowa gambling task. In summary, the present work is the first to demonstrate systematic violations of the independence principle in various decisions-from-experience designs and to offer a model to explain the observed phenomena.},

The present hypothesis proposed that an asymmetrical change of weights of attributes would influence the relationship between options, and, consequently, the attraction effect would vary. The present study comprised two studies. In study 1, participants made choices among three lotteries in near and distant future conditions. Study 2 asked the participants to choose among three events in similar and dissimilar other conditions. The results showed that the choice of the asymmetrically dominating option, which was superior in superordinate attributes, increased as the psychological distance increased, whereas the choice of the asymmetrically dominating option, which was superior in subordinate attributes, decreased or stayed static.},

	abstract = {In the attraction effect, adding a dominated third option to a choice set of two options can alter preferences for the original two options and increase the dominating option’s choice share. This can constitute a violation of the axioms of regularity and independence from irrelevant alternatives, which are core properties of any choice model in which the utility of each option is stable across choice sets. In the past 20 years, the attraction effect has driven the development of a set of inﬂuential models of multiattribute choice. However, two studies (Frederick et al., 2014; Yang \& Lynn, 2014) involving a series of experiments with naturalistic choice options (e.g., snacks, movies) found no evidence for the attraction effect in choice contexts where alternatives are represented without objectively deﬁned (e.g., numerical) attribute dimensions—a ﬁnding that would severely undermine its theoretical importance. Huber et al. (2014) criticized these studies, laying down a set of criteria that should be met by any experiment wishing to test for the attraction effect in real-world consumer choices. Based on these criteria, this article presents a carefully designed experiment testing the attraction effect with movies as naturalistic choice options. The results show a precisely zero attraction effect.},

In the experiments reported here, we showed that these effects also arise in simple perceptual-decision-making tasks. This finding casts doubt on explanations limited to consumer choice and high-level decisions, and it indicates that context effects may be amenable to a general explanation at the level of the basic decision process. We demonstrated for the first time that three important context effects from the preferential-choice literature—similarity, attraction, and compromise effects—all occurred within a single perceptual-decision task. Not only do our results challenge previous explanations for context effects proposed by consumer researchers, but they also challenge the choice rules assumed in theories of perceptual decision making.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been a robust debate in decision neuroscience and psychology about what mechanism governs the time course of decision-making. Historically, the most prominent hypothesis is that neural architectures accumulate information over time until some threshold is met, the so-called Evidence Accumulation hypothesis. However, most applications of this theory rely on simplifying assumptions, belying a number of potential complexities. Is changing stimulus information perceived and processed in an independent manner or is there a relative component? Does urgency play a role? What about evidence leakage? Although the latter questions have been the subject of recent investigations, most studies to date have been piecemeal in nature, addressing one aspect of the decision process or another. Here we develop a modeling framework, an extension of the Urgency Gating Model, in conjunction with a changing information experimental paradigm to simultaneously probe these aspects of the decision process. Using state-of-the-art Bayesian methods to perform parameter-based inference, we find that (a) information processing is relative with early information influencing the perception of late information, (b) time varying urgency and evidence accumulation are of roughly equal strength in the decision process, and (c) leakage is present with a time scale of ϳ200 –250 ms. We also show that these effects can only be identified in a changing information paradigm. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to utilize a changing information paradigm to jointly and quantitatively estimate the temporal dynamics of human decision-making.},

Traditional explanations focus on how values are represented, but little is known about how values are integrated. Here we outline a psychophysical task for value integration that can be used as a window on high-level, multiattribute decisions. Participants choose between alternative rapidly presented streams of numerical values. By controlling the temporal distribution of the values, we demonstrate that this process underlies many puzzling choice paradoxes, such as temporal, risk, and framing biases, as well as preference reversals. These phenomena can be explained by a simple mechanism based on the integration of values, weighted by their salience. The salience of a sampled value depends on its temporal order and momentary rank in the decision context, whereas the direction of the weighting is determined by the task framing. We show that many known choice anomalies may arise from the microstructure of the value integration process.},

This effect is believed to depend on relatively effortless and intuitive processing (System 1) rather than on effortful and elaborative processing (System 2). To investigate the relationship between cognitive resources and the attraction effect in detail, we used a taskirrelevant probe technique, wherein task-irrelevant auditory probes were presented while participants viewed each alternative in a decision-making task, and measured the electroencephalographic responses to the probes. Thirty participants solved 48 hypothetical purchase problems with three alternatives that differed in terms of two attributes. We found that, in the second epoch of the experimental trials (possibly corresponding to the evaluation and comparison stage), the mean N1 amplitudes of the event-related potentials elicited by the auditory probes were signiﬁcantly smaller when participants chose the competitor (i.e., trials in which no attraction effect occurred) than when participants chose the target (i.e., trials in which an attraction effect may have occurred). This result suggests that the allocation of more cognitive resources to the alternatives disrupts the attraction effect. This ﬁnding supports the assumption that intuitive comparisons among alternatives executed by System 1 are critical for the occurrence of the attraction effect.},

These mechanisms create interesting predictions for the dynamics of the deliberation process as well as the aggregate behavior of preferential choice in a variety of contexts. However, the models that embody these different mechanisms are rarely subjected to rigorous quantitative tests of suitability by way of model fitting and evaluation. Recently, complex, stochastic models have been cast aside in favor of simpler approximations, which may or may not capture the data as well. In this article, we use a recently developed method to fit the four extant models of context effects to data from two experiments: one involving consumer goods stimuli, and another involving perceptual stimuli. Our third study investigates the relative merits of the mechanisms currently assumed by the extant models of context effects by testing every possible configuration of mechanism within one overarching model. Across all tasks, our results emphasize the importance of several mechanisms such as lateral inhibition, loss aversion, and pairwise attribute differences, as these mechanisms contribute positively to model performance. Together, our results highlight the notion that mathematical tractability, while certainly a convenient feature of any model, should neither be the primary impetus for model development nor the promoting or demotion of specific model mechanisms. Instead, model fit, balanced with model complexity, should be the greatest burden to bear for any theoretical account of empirical phenomena.},

	abstract = {Much recent evidence suggests some dramatic differences in the way people learn perceptual categories, depending on exactly how the categories were constructed. Four different kinds of category-learning tasks are currently popular—rule-based tasks, information-integration tasks, prototype distortion tasks, and the weather prediction task. The cognitive, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging results obtained using these four tasks are qualitatively different. Success in rule-based (explicit reasoning) tasks depends on frontal-striatal circuits and requires working memory and executive attention. Success in information-integration tasks requires a form of procedural learning and is sensitive to the nature and timing of feedback. Prototype distortion tasks induce perceptual (visual cortical) learning. A variety of different strategies can lead to success in the weather prediction task. Collectively, results from these four tasks provide strong evidence that human category learning is mediated by multiple, qualitatively distinct systems.},

Exemplar theory has been the most prominent cognitive theory of categorization for more than 30 years. Despite its considerable success in providing good quantitative fits to a wide variety of accuracy data, it has never had a detailed neurobiological interpretation. This article proposes a neural interpretation of exemplar theory in which category learning is mediated by synaptic plasticity at cortical-striatal synapses. In this model, categorization training does not create new memory representations, rather it alters connectivity between striatal neurons and neurons in sensory association cortex. The new model makes identical quantitative predictions as exemplar theory, yet it can account for many empirical phenomena that are either incompatible with or outside the scope of the cognitive version of exemplar theory.},

First, a number of important experimental design choices are discussed, including: 1) whether a categorization or identiﬁcation experiment is more appropriate, 2) what type of category structure should be used, 3) how to choose the stimuli, 4) how to construct the categories so they have optimal statistical properties, 5) how to present feedback following each response, and 5) design choices that make it easy to assess participant performance. Second, several specialized methods for analyzing categorization data are described, including forward and backward learning curves, and a statistical procedure for strategy analysis that can identify participants who were guessing, using a single-cue explicit rule, or using some multi-cue similarity-based strategy.},

In this paper, we study the generation of new categories using the computational and behavioral toolkit of traditional artiﬁcial category learning. Previous work in this domain has focused on how the statistical structure of known categories generalizes to generated categories, overlooking whether (and if so, how) contrast between the known and generated categories is a factor. We report three experiments demonstrating that contrast between what is known and what is created is of fundamental importance for categorization. We propose two novel approaches to modeling category contrast: one focused on exemplar dissimilarity and another on the representativeness heuristic. Our experiments and computational analyses demonstrate that both models capture diﬀerent aspects of contrast’s role in categorization.},

However, the questions of how the category structure influences this advantage and how simultaneous presentation interacts with the advantage are open issues. In this article, we present three experiments. The first experiment indicates that the advantage of interleaved over blocked study is modulated by the structure of the categories being studied. More specifically, interleaved study results in better generalization for categories with high within- and between-category similarity, whereas blocked presentation results in better generalization for categories with low within- and between-category similarity. In Experiment 2, we present evidence that when presented simultaneously, between-category comparisons (interleaved presentation) result in a performance advantage for high-similarity categories, but no differences were found for low-similarity categories. In Experiment 3, we directly compared simultaneous and successive presentation of low-similarity categories. We again found an overall benefit for blocked study with these categories. Overall, these results are consistent with the proposal that interleaving emphasizes differences between categories, whereas blocking emphasizes the discovery of commonalities among objects within the same category.},

This process involves both high level cognitive processes (categorization) and low-level perceptual encoding of the acoustic signal, both of which are affected by the use of a cochlear implant (CI) device. The goal of this study was twofold: I) compare the categorization strategies of CI users and normal hearing listeners (NHL) II) investigate if any characteristics of the raw acoustic signal could explain the results. 16 experienced CI users and 20 NHL were tested using a Free-Sorting Task of 16 common sounds divided into 3 predeﬁned categories of environmental, musical and vocal sounds. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Hierarchical Clustering based on Principal Components (HCPC) show that CI users followed a similar categorization strategy to that of NHL and were able to discriminate between the three different types of sounds. However results for CI users were more varied and showed less inter-participant agreement. Acoustic analysis also highlighted the average pitch salience and average autocorrelation peak as being important for the perception and categorization of the sounds. The results therefore show that on a broad level of categorization CI users may not have as many difﬁculties as previously thought in discriminating certain kinds of sound; however the perception of individual sounds remains challenging.},

Although much work has attempted to distinguish between particular types of reference point models, they share a core design principle that items will be classified as belonging to the category of the most proximal reference point(s). In this paper, we present an original experiment challenging this distance assumption. After classification training on a modified XOR category structure, we find that many learners generalize their category knowledge to novel exemplars in a manner that violates the distance assumption. This pattern of performance reveals a fundamental limitation in the reference point framework and suggests that stimulus generalization is not a reliable foundation for explaining human category learning.},

We present experiments that pose a significant challenge to popular reference point accounts which explain categorization in terms of stimulus generalization from exemplars, prototypes, or adaptive clusters. DIVA, a similarity-based alternative to the reference point framework, provides a successful account of the human data.

We investigated whether this apparent beneﬁt of interleaved presentation extended to the learning of educationally relevant scientiﬁc categories (i.e., organic chemicals), and also whether the following factors played a role: (a) the level of similarity among the examples and (b) highlighting of the diagnostic features of each category during training. Across four experiments, we found that interleaved presentation beneﬁtted learning of the chemical categories, with simple as well as more complex categories. Neither the level of similarity among the examples nor highlighting the diagnostic features of a category inﬂuenced the interleaving advantage, although highlighting the diagnostic features did improve learning overall. These ﬁndings suggest that students may beneﬁt from the interleaving of different categories during science instruction, even when the teacher (or the textbook) explicitly points out the diagnostic features of each category to help learning.},

The category space was composed of 3 nonoverlapping, linearly separable categories whose members were structured, temporal events. Each stimulus was composed of a sequence of on–off events that varied in duration and number of subevents (complexity). Categories were learned visually, haptically, or auditorily and transferred to the same or another modality. Despite the isomorphism across modalities, significant differences appeared in both learning and transfer. The visual modality showed an early learning advantage, with information on the transfer test preserved best when encoded visually during learning, worst when encoded haptically, with auditory encoding intermediate. False recognition rates were elevated when categories were learned haptically and transferred to another modality. In general, classification accuracy was highest for the category prototype, with false recognition of the category prototype higher in the cross-modality conditions. The results are discussed in terms of current theories in modality transfer including the difficulties inherent when calculation of similarity must be considered in a cross-modal situation.},

The results demonstrated transfer gradients tracked the prototype category rather than the feedback category of the exception category. In Experiment 2, transfer performance was investigated for categories varying in size (5, 10, 20), partially crossed with the number of exception patterns (1, 2, 4). Here, the generalization gradients tracked the feedback category of the training instance when category size was small but tracked the prototype category when category size was large. The benefits of increased category size still emerged, even with proportionality of exception patterns held constant. These, and other outcomes, were consistent with a mixed model of classification, in which exemplar influences were dominant with small-sized categories and/or high error rates, and prototype influences were dominant with larger sized categories.},

Previous demonstrations of this effect have occurred solely in a single-category paradigm in which transfer patterns are assigned or not to the learning category. We tested the hypothesis that any extraneous variable potentially responsible for this effect, such as compactness varying with pattern distortion (Zaki \& Nosofsky, 2004), may be functional in the single-category paradigm but not when multiple categories are available at the time of transfer. In the present study, subjects received a bogus or a real category learning phase, followed by a transfer test that required assignment into 1 or 3 prototype categories. The results showed that a minimal prototype gradient was obtained in the bogus conditions, with performance approaching chance levels when classification into 3 categories was required. In contrast, a substantial prototype gradient effect was found following learning. We conclude that the prototype gradient typically obtained following multiplecategory learning is primarily driven by real learning and that the false prototype effect is itself an artifact of the single-category paradigm.},

Following 6 learning blocks, subjects transferred to old patterns and new patterns at low-, medium-, and high-level distortions of the category prototype. The results showed that array training facilitated learning, especially when patterns in the array belonged to the same category. Transfer results showed a strong gradient effect across pattern distortion level for all conditions, with the highest performance obtained following array training on different category patterns and worst in the control condition. Interestingly, the old training patterns were classified worse than new low and no better than medium distortions. Neither this ordering nor the steepness of the gradient across prototype similarity for each condition could be predicted by the generalized context model. A prototype model better captured the steep gradient and ordinal pattern of results, although the overall fits were only slightly better than the exemplar model.

The results showed substantial learning in each experiment, with the notable result that learning was not slowed in the non-repeating condition in any of the three experiments. Furthermore, subsequent transfer was marginally better in the non-repeating condition. The recognition results showed that subjects in the repeat condition had substantial memory for the training instances, whereas subjects in the non-repeat condition had no measurable memory for the training instances, as measured either by hit and false-alarm rates or by signal detectability measures. These outcomes are consistent with prototype models of category learning, at least when patterns never repeat in learning, and place severe constraints on exemplar views that posit transfer mechanisms to stored individual traces.

We call this method discrete Markov chain Monte Carlo with people (d-MCMCP). We illustrate our method by evaluating the following categories over datasets: emotions as represented by facial images, moral concepts as represented by relevant words, and seasons as represented by images drawn from large online databases. Three experiments demonstrate that dMCMCP is powerful and flexible enough to work with complex, naturalistic stimuli drawn from large online databases.},

The generative approach solves the categorization problem by building a probabilistic model of each category and using Bayes’ rule to infer category labels. In contrast, the discriminative approach directly learns a mapping between inputs and category labels. With this distinction in mind, we revisit a previously studied categorization experiment that showed people are biased towards categorizing objects into a category with higher variability. Modelling results predict that generative learners should be more greatly affected by category variability than discriminative learners. We show that humans can be prompted to adopt either a generative or discriminative approach to learning the same input, resulting in the predicted effect on use of category variability.},

(2019) tested a condition in which individual training instances never repeated, and observed results that they claimed severely challenged exemplar models of classiﬁcation and recognition. Among the results was a dissociation in which participants classiﬁed transfer items with high accuracy in the norepeat condition, yet in old-new recognition tests showed no ability to discriminate between old and new items of the same level of distortion from the prototype. In addition, speed of classiﬁcation learning was no faster in a condition in which a small set of training instances was repeated continuously compared with the no-repeat condition. Here we show through computer-simulation modeling that exemplar models naturally capture the classiﬁcation-recognition dissociation in the no-repeat condition, as well as a wide variety of other qualitative effects reported by Homa et al. (2019). We also conduct new conceptual-replication experiments to investigate their reported null effect of repeated versus nonrepeated training instances on speed of classiﬁcation learning. In contrast to Homa et al. (2019) we ﬁnd that speed of learning is substantially faster in the repeat condition than in the no-repeat condition, precisely as exemplar models predict. The exemplar model also captures a wide variety of transfer effects observed following the completion of category learning, including the classiﬁcation-recognition dissociation observed across the repeat and no-repeat conditions.},

A synthesis of computational and behavioral approaches is brought to bear to advance a similarity-based account that rejects the stimulus generalization underpinnings of the reference point view (such as exemplar models) and extends its explanatory scope beyond the circumscribed traditional artiﬁcial classiﬁcation learning (TACL) paradigm. The framework advanced in this chapter emphasizes the role of generative (as opposed to discriminative) category learning and takes its focus in the form of the DIVA model based on a neural network architecture called the divergent autoencoder. Directions and advances that extend beyond TACL include: modes of category learning, item presentation conditions, types of categories, and measures of category representation.},

	abstract = {While the ability to acquire non-linearly separable (NLS) classifications is well documented in the study of human category learning, the relative ease of learning compared to a linear separable structure is difficult to evaluate without potential confounds. Medin and Schwanenflugel (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 7, 355-368, 1981) were the first to demonstrate that NLS classifications are not more difficult to acquire than linearly separable ones when structures are equated in terms of within- and between-category similarities. However, their evidence is less sturdy than might be expected due to non-standard methodology and low sample size. We conducted a conceptual replication to clarify the behavioral picture and perform qualitative testing of formal models. The behavioral results not only showed a lack of advantage for the linearly separable (LS) structure, but revealed a stronger finding: the NLS structure was reliably easier to acquire. Differences in the relative ease of NLS learners to master certain items yielded evidence for the existence of distinct learner subgroups, one marked by significantly easier (not harder) learning of exception items. Comparing the qualitative fits of leading computational models to the human learning performance confirmed that a pure prototype account, even with contemporary updates, remains incompatible with the data. However, exemplar models and similarity-based models grounded in sophisticated forms of abstraction-based learning successfully account for the NLS advantage. In sum, evidence against a linear separability constraint is redoubled, and the observed NLS advantage along with behavioral patterns seen at the subgroup and item level provide a valuable basis for comprehensive evaluation of competing theoretical accounts and models.},

	abstract = {The traditional supervised classification paradigm encourages learners to acquire only the knowledge needed to predict category membership (a discriminative approach). An alternative that aligns with important aspects of realworld concept formation is learning with a broader focus to acquire knowledge of the internal structure of each category (a generative approach). Our work addresses the impact of a particular component of the traditional classification task: the guess-and-correct cycle. We compare classification learning to a supervised observational learning task in which learners are shown labeled examples but make no classification response. The goals of this work sit at two levels: (1) testing for differences in the nature of the category representations that arise from two basic learning modes; and (2) evaluating the generative/discriminative continuum as a theoretical tool for understand learning modes and their outcomes. Specifically, we view the guess-and-correct cycle as consistent with a more discriminative approach and therefore expected it to lead to narrower category knowledge. Across two experiments, the observational mode led to greater sensitivity to distributional properties of features and correlations between features. We conclude that a relatively subtle procedural difference in supervised category learning substantially impacts what learners come to know about the categories. The results demonstrate the value of the generative/ discriminative continuum as a tool for advancing the psychology of category learning and also provide a valuable constraint for formal models and associated theories.},

	abstract = {In the study of perceptual categorization, a key distinction is made between integral and separable dimensions. Integral dimensions are often highly unanalyzable, while separable dimensions are highly analyzable and easy to attend in isolation. Little, Wang, and Nosofsky (2016) showed that when trial-by-trial responses are analyzed, a consistent pattern of sequential effects was found in a modiﬁed Garner paradigm using integral-dimension stimuli. The present experiments investigate whether these pronounced sequential eﬀects are also found with separable-dimension stimuli. Two experiments using diﬀerent separable dimensions were conducted. The results indicate that similar patterns of sequential eﬀects were present for separabledimension stimuli, but, unlike for integral dimensions, the eﬀect of a change in the irrelevant dimension in the ﬁltering task was not found. Further, for separable dimensions, the overall pattern of sequential eﬀects did not vary between the Garner tasks (i.e., control, correlated, and ﬁltering). To explain these results, we ﬁt a sequence-sensitive exemplar model and compared the ﬁts of this model to a novel sequence-sensitive feature model, in which only the relevant feature inﬂuences the categorization decision. We ﬁnd that this feature-based model provides a more compelling account of our separable dimension data, while the full exemplar model provides a better account of the integral dimension data. The ﬁndings of the present study provide a more complete understanding of perceptual categorization and add to the growing body of literature on the prevalence and critical implications of strong sequential eﬀects in cognitive tasks.},

In MCPL, normatively irrelevant cues are usually ignored, which stands in apparent conflict with recent research in deterministic categorization that has shown that people sometimes use irrelevant cues to gate access to partial knowledge encapsulated in independent partitions. The authors report 2 experiments that sought support for the existence of such knowledge partitioning in probabilistic categorization. The results indicate that, as in other areas of concept acquisition (such as function learning and deterministic categorization), a significant proportion of participants partitioned their knowledge on the basis of an irrelevant cue. The authors show by computational modeling that knowledge partitioning cannot be accommodated by 2 exemplar models (Generalized Context Model and Rapid Attention Shifts ‘N Learning), whereas a rule-based model (General Recognition Theory) can capture partitioned performance. The authors conclude by pointing to the necessity of a mixture-of-experts approach to capture performance in MCPL and by identifying reduction of complexity as a possible explanation for partitioning.},

For example, when learning how to solve math problems, students may focus on superﬁcial attributes of the problems and memorize procedures for solving them, or they may abstract underlying rules or regularities to understand why certain procedures are appropriate. These different strategies have implications for what students learn. In the present paper, we suggest that laboratory research investigating individual differences in exemplar-based versus rule-based representations (and the strategies that afford these representations, which we postulate to be memorization and rule-abstraction, respectively) might have implications for student learning. We also develop the notion that one’s strategy might persist across tasks in different domains and then discuss the extent to which laboratory tasks might predict outcomes in educational contexts. Finally, we discuss avenues for future research and the applicability of current research to educational practice.},

	abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) rival humans in object recognition. The layers (or levels of representation) in DCNNs have been successfully aligned with processing stages along the ventral stream for visual processing. Here, we propose a model of concept learning that uses visual representations from these networks to build memory representations of novel categories, which may rely on the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Our approach opens up two possibilities: a) formal investigations can involve photographic stimuli as opposed to stimuli handcrafted and coded by the experimenter; b) model comparison can determine which level of representation within a DCNN a learner is using during categorization decisions. Pursuing the latter point, DCNNs suggest that the shape bias in children relies on representations at more advanced network layers whereas a learner that relied on lower network layers would display a color bias. These results conﬁrm the role of natural statistics in the shape bias (i.e., shape is predictive of category membership) while highlighting that the type of statistics matter, i.e., those from lower or higher levels of representation. We use the same approach to provide evidence that pigeons performing seemingly sophisticated categorization of complex imagery may in fact be relying on representations that are very low-level (i.e., retinotopic). Although complex features, such as shape, relatively predominate at more advanced network layers, even simple features, such as spatial frequency and orientation, are better represented at the more advanced layers, contrary to a standard hierarchical view.},

We used the well-studied 5-4 category structure of Medin and Schaffer (1978), which allows transfer of category learning to new stimuli to be discriminated as a function of rule-based or similarity-based category knowledge. In the rule-based training condition (thought to facilitate the learning of abstract logical rules and hypothesized to produce rule-based classification), items were grouped by subcategories and randomized within each subcategory. In the similarity-based training condition (thought to facilitate associative learning and hypothesized to produce exemplar classification), transitions between items within the same category were determined by their featural similarity and subcategories were ignored. We found that transfer patterns depended on whether the presentation order was similarity-based, or rule-based, with the participants particularly capitalizing on the rule-based order.},

One method for facilitating the category learning of naturalistic stimuli may be to provide explicit feature descriptions that highlight the characteristic features of each category. Although this method is commonly used in textbooks and classrooms, theoretically it remains uncertain whether feature descriptions should advantage learning complex natural-science categories. In three experiments, participants were trained on 12 categories of rocks, either without or with a brief description highlighting key features of each category. After training, they were tested on their ability to categorize both old and new rocks from each of the categories. Providing feature descriptions as a caption under a rock image failed to improve category learning relative to providing only the rock image with its category label (Experiment 1). However, when these same feature descriptions were presented such that they were explicitly linked to the relevant parts of the rock image (feature highlighting), participants showed significantly higher performance on both immediate generalization to new rocks (Experiment 2) and generalization after a 2-day delay (Experiment 3). Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

A low-parameter version of an exemplar-memory model, used in combination with a high-dimensional feature-space representation for the rock stimuli, provided good overall accounts of the categorization data. The successful accounts included (a) predicting how performance on individual item types within the categories varied with the distributions of training examples, (b) predicting the overall levels of classification accuracy across the different rock categories, and (c) predicting the patterns of between-category confusions that arose when classification errors were made. The work represents a promising initial step in scaling up the application of formal models of perceptual classification learning to complex natural-category domains.

An eightdimensional representation yields good accounts of naive participants’ judgments of similarity among a large battery of rock-picture samples; furthermore, the eight dimensions have natural psychological interpretations.

	abstract = {Background: Most science categories are hierarchically organized, with various high-level divisions comprising numerous subtypes. If we suppose that one’s goal is to teach students to classify at the high level, past research has provided mixed evidence about whether an effective strategy is to require simultaneous classification learning of the subtypes. This past research was limited, however, either because authentic science categories were not tested, or because the procedures did not allow participants to form strong associations between subtype-level and high-level category names. Here we investigate a two-stage response-training procedure in which participants provide both a high-level and subtype-level response on most trials, with feedback provided at both levels. The procedure is tested in experiments in which participants learn to classify large sets of rocks that are representative of those taught in geoscience classes.
Results: The two-stage procedure yielded high-level classification performance that was as good as the performance of comparison groups who were trained solely at the high level. In addition, the two-stage group achieved far greater knowledge of the hierarchical structure of the categories than did the comparison controls.
Conclusion: In settings in which students are tasked with learning high-level names for rock types that are commonly taught in geoscience classes, it is best for students to learn simultaneously at the high and subtype levels (using training techniques similar to the presently investigated one). Beyond providing insights into the nature of category learning and representation, these findings have practical significance for improving science education.},

Many of the examples come from our specific project that examines teaching rock classifications in the geologic sciences. This project uses formal models of human category learning—developed in cognitive psychology—to search for optimal teaching procedures. The model-suggested category-teaching procedures often lead to better learning outcomes than do alternative procedures motivated by teachers’ and students’ intuitive judgments.

	abstract = {In three perceptual classification experiments involving ill-defined category structures, extreme prototype enhancement effects were observed in which prototypes were classified more accurately than other category instances. Such empirical findings can prove theoretically challenging to exemplar-based models of categorization if prototypes are psychological central tendencies of category instances. We found instead that category prototypes were sometimes better characterized as psychological extreme points relative to contrast categories. Extending a classic and widely cited study (Posner \& Keele, 1968), participants learned categories created from distortions of dot patterns arranged in familiar shapes. Participants then made pairwise similarity judgements of the patterns. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses of the similarity data revealed the prototypes to be psychological extreme points, not central tendencies. Evidence for extreme point representations was also found for novel prototype patterns displaying a symmetry structure and for prototypes of grid patterns used in recent studies by McLaren and colleagues (McLaren, Bennet, Guttman-Nahir, Kim, \& Mackintosh, 1995). When used in combination with the derived M DS solutions, an exemplar-based model of categorization, the Generalized Context Model (Nosofsky, 1986), provided good fits to the observed categorization data in all three experiments.},

	abstract = {A plurality of the categories we hold exhibit family resemblance (FR; i.e., many characteristic but few defining features), suggesting FR may occupy a central role in human category formation. However, research in unsupervised learning has shown that when people are asked to sort an array of novel items into categories, they ubiquitously use a unidimensional (UNI) rule – despite the availability of a FR solution. This work suggests that, perhaps, FR similarity is not a core tendency in category formation. Here, we question whether the UNI bias is a result of the sorting paradigm. Specifically, we speculate the paradigm conflates two components vital for category formation: production and evaluation. Across three experiments we show that when evaluation is separated from generation – by using a novel forced-choice task that pits different category organizational schemes against one another – people exhibit a FR over UNI preference. The implications of these results are discussed.},

In the current work, we contribute a novel investigation of semi-supervised learning by extending the paradigm to relational category learning and evaluating the role that item similarity plays in the effectiveness of unsupervised learning opportunities. Our results show firstever evidence of semi-supervised learning in the induction of relational categories and, further, that the similarity between supervised and unsupervised examples critically dictates whether benefits of unsupervised exposures accrue.

Over 30 studies have shown that the exemplar-based generalized context model (GCM) usually provides a better quantitative account of 5– 4 learning data as compared with the prototype model. However, J. D. Smith and J. P. Minda (2000) argued that the GCM is a psychologically implausible account of 5– 4 learning because it implies suboptimal attention weights. To test this claim, the authors recorded undergraduates’ eye movements while the students learned the 5– 4 category structure. Eye fixations matched the attention weights estimated by the GCM but not those of the prototype model. This result confirms that the GCM is a realistic model of the processes involved in learning the 5– 4 structure and that learners do not always optimize attention, as commonly supposed. The conditions under which learners are likely to optimize attention during category learning are discussed.},

Previous research had reported that linearly separable II categories are easier to learn than nonlinearly separable categories, but Experiment 1, which compared performance on linearly and nonlinearly separable categories that were equated as closely as possible on all other factors that might aﬀect diﬃculty, found that linear separability had no eﬀect on learning. Experiments 1 and 2 together also established a novel dissociation between RB and II category learning: increasing variability on irrelevant stimulus dimensions impaired II learning but not RB learning. These results are all predicted by the best available measures of diﬃculty in RB and II tasks.},

	abstract = {Rational models of cognition typically consider the abstract computational problems posed by the environment, assuming that people are capable of optimally solving those problems. This differs from more traditional formal models of cognition, which focus on the psychological processes responsible for behavior. A basic challenge for rational models is thus explaining how optimal solutions can be approximated by psychological processes. We outline a general strategy for answering this question, namely to explore the psychological plausibility of approximation algorithms developed in computer science and statistics. In particular, we argue that Monte Carlo methods provide a source of rational process models that connect optimal solutions to psychological processes. We support this argument through a detailed example, applying this approach to Anderson’s (1990, 1991) rational model of categorization (RMC), which involves a particularly challenging computational problem. Drawing on a connection between the RMC and ideas from nonparametric Bayesian statistics, we propose 2 alternative algorithms for approximate inference in this model. The algorithms we consider include Gibbs sampling, a procedure appropriate when all stimuli are presented simultaneously, and particle filters, which sequentially approximate the posterior distribution with a small number of samples that are updated as new data become available. Applying these algorithms to several existing datasets shows that a particle filter with a single particle provides a good description of human inferences.},

	abstract = {Most natural domains can be represented in multiple ways: we can categorize foods in terms of their nutritional content or social role, animals in terms of their taxonomic groupings or their ecological niches, and musical instruments in terms of their taxonomic categories or social uses. Previous approaches to modeling human categorization have largely ignored the problem of cross-categorization, focusing on learning just a single system of categories that explains all of the features. Cross-categorization presents a difﬁcult problem: how can we infer categories without ﬁrst knowing which features the categories are meant to explain? We present a novel model that suggests that human cross-categorization is a result of joint inference about multiple systems of categories and the features that they explain. We also formalize two commonly proposed alternative explanations for cross-categorization behavior: a features-ﬁrst and an objects-ﬁrst approach. The features-ﬁrst approach suggests that cross-categorization is a consequence of attentional processes, where features are selected by an attentional mechanism ﬁrst and categories are derived second. The objects-ﬁrst approach suggests that crosscategorization is a consequence of repeated, sequential attempts to explain features, where categories are derived ﬁrst, then features that are poorly explained are recategorized. We present two sets of simulations and experiments testing the models’ predictions about human categorization. We ﬁnd that an approach based on joint inference provides the best ﬁt to human categorization behavior, and we suggest that a full account of human category learning will need to incorporate something akin to these capabilities.},

Across two experiments, participants engaged in classification learning without exceptions, with an easy exception, or with a difficult exception. Pairwise similarity ratings for all items were collected before and after learning to index compression. Results from Experiment 1 suggest that difficult exceptions can impede compression for the contrast category when situated within its cluster, while results from Experiment 2 suggest that both kinds of exceptions can impair compression of standard items in a target category relative to the No Exception control. We also observed surprising evidence of a novel between-category compression effect that was observed with the category structure developed for these experiments.},

	title = {The spatial arrangement method of measuring similarity can capture high-dimensional, semantic},
	abstract = {Psychologists collect similarity data to study a variety of phenomena including categorization, generalization and discrimination, and representation itself. However, collecting similarity judgments between all pairs of items in a set is expensive, spurring development of techniques like the Spatial Arrangement Method (SpAM; Goldstone, 1994), wherein participants place items on a 2-dimensional plane such that proximity reflects perceived similarity. While SpAM greatly hastens similarity measurement, and has been successfully used for lower-dimensional, perceptual stimuli, its suitability for higher-dimensional, conceptual stimuli is less understood. In Study 1, we evaluated the ability of SpAM to capture the semantic structure of eight different categories composed of 20-30 words each. First, SpAM distances correlated strongly (r=.71) with pairwise similarity judgments, although below SpAM and pairwise judgment split-half reliabilities (r’s{\textgreater}.9). Second, a cross-validation exercise with multidimensional scaling fits at increasing latent dimensionalities suggested that aggregated SpAM data favored higher ({\textgreater}2) dimensional solutions for 7 of the 8 categories explored here. Third, split-half reliability of SpAM dissimilarities was high (Pearson r=.90), while the average correlation between pairs of participants was low (r=.15), suggesting that when different participants focus on different pairs of stimulus dimensions, reliable high-dimensional aggregate similarity data is recoverable. In study 2, we show that SpAM can recover the Big Five factor space of personality trait adjectives, and that cross-validation favors a four or five dimension solution on this dataset. We conclude that SpAM is an accurate and reliable method of measuring similarity for high-dimensional items like words. We publicly release our data for researchers.},

Here, we used a combination of computational modeling and functional neuroimaging to understand how humans classify visual stimuli drawn from categories whose mean and variance jumped unpredictably. Models based on optimal learning (Bayesian model) and a cognitive strategy (working memory model) both explained unique variance in choice, reaction time, and brain activity. However, the working memory model was the best predictor of performance in volatile environments, whereas statistically optimal performance emerged in periods of relative stability. Bayesian and working memory models predicted decision-related activity in distinct regions of the prefrontal cortex and midbrain. These ﬁndings suggest that perceptual category judgments, like value-guided choices, may be guided by multiple controllers.},

Within the model, we show how the principles of instance and strength theories can be instantiated, so that the validity of their assumptions can be tested against experimental data. We show how under some conditions, models embodying instance representations can be considered a special case of a strength-based representation. We discuss a number of mechanisms for producing adaptive behaviors in dynamic environments, and detail how they may be instantiated within ARM. To evaluate the relative strengths of the proposed mechanisms, we construct a suite of 10 model variants, and fit them to single-trial choice response time data from three experiments. The first experiment involves dynamic shifts in the frequency of category exposure, the second experiment involves shifts in the means of the category distributions, and the third experiment involves shifts in both the mean and variance of the category distributions. We evaluate model performance by assessing model fit, penalized for complexity, at both the individual and aggregate levels. We show that the mechanisms of prediction error and lateral inhibition are strong contributors to the successes of the model variants considered here. Our results suggest that the joint distribution of choice and response time can be thought of as an emergent property of an evolving representation mapping stimulus attributes to their appropriate response assignment.},

This means not only that their review excludes a major body of current work in the field, but also that it does not consider the body of work that provides the best current answers to the issues raised. In this comment, we argue that Bayesian methods can be—and, in most cases, already have been—applied to all the major model evaluation issues raised by Wills and Pothos (2012). In particular, Bayesian methods can address the challenges of avoiding overfitting, considering qualitative properties of data, reducing dependence on free parameters, and testing empirical breadth.},

Four experiments examined whether participants preferred variability when making study choices with the goal of later classifying novel exemplars.

After study, participants classiﬁed novel exemplars from studied categories. The majority of participants showed a consistent preference for variability in their study, but choices were not related to category-level assessments of learning. Experiment 4 provided evidence that study preferences were based primarily on theoretical beliefs in that most participants indicated a preference for variability on questionnaires that did not include prior experience with exemplars.

However, the field has seen a proliferation of noncomplementary models with little consensus on the relative adequacy of these accounts. Progress in assessing the relative adequacy of formal categorization models has, to date, been limited because (a) formal model comparisons are narrow in the number of models and phenomena considered and (b) models do not often clearly define their explanatory scope. Progress is further hampered by the practice of fitting models with arbitrarily variable parameters to each data set independently. Reviewing examples of good practice in the literature, we conclude that model comparisons are most fruitful when relative adequacy is assessed by comparing well-defined models on the basis of the number and proportion of irreversible, ordinal, penetrable successes (principles of minimal flexibility, breadth, good-enough precision, maximal simplicity, and psychological focus).},

Generally, previous studies have employed categorization tasks 
that are less demanding than the recognition tasks. In this 
study, we distinguish between single-system and multiple-system 
accounts by testing memory-impaired individuals in a more demanding 
categorization task. These patients, just like previous amnesic 
participants, show a dissociation between categorization and 
recognition when tested in previously employed paradigms. However, 
they display a categorization deficit when tested in the more 
challenging categorization task. The results are interpreted 
as support for a single-system framework in which categorization 
and recognition depend on one representational system.

It was Garner who provided the consensual definition of the separable-integral partition of stimulus dimensions, delineating a set of converging operations sustaining the distinction. This distinction is a pillar of today’s cognitive science. We review the key ideas, definitions, and findings along 2 paths of the evolution of Garnerian research: selective attention, with a focus on Garner interference and its relation to the Stroop effect, and divided attention, with focus on perceptual independence gauged by multivariate models of perception. The review tracks developments in a roughly chronological order. Our review is also integrative as we follow the evolution of a set of nascent ideas into the vast multifaceted enterprise that they comprise today.

	abstract = {This article reviews recent research that has examined consumer decision making when the option of not choosing any of the alternatives is provided. The attractiveness of the decision outcomes and the difﬁculty of choosing are posited to be two key factors that determine the preference for a no-choice option. Building on the notion that preferences are often constructed, it is proposed that task and contextual variables can alter how the choice situation is evaluated on the two factors and consequently choice incidence. Several experiments that explore and manipulate decision attractiveness and decision difﬁculty are reviewed, and areas for future research are suggested. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for research on consumer choice.},

Traditional models of similarity posit that increasing the number of differences between objects cannot increase judged similarity between them. In contrast to these previous models, the present research shows that introducing a small difference in an attribute that previously was identical across objects can increase perceived similarity between those objects. We propose an explanation based on the idea that small differences draw more attention than identical attributes do and that people’s perceptions of similarity involve averaging attributes that are salient. We provide evidence that introducing small differences between objects increases perceived similarity. We also show that an increase in similarity decreases the difficulty of choice and the likelihood that a choice will be deferred.},

Recent studies, however, imply that choice deferral is more tightly associated with the difﬁculty in evaluating alternatives than with set size: when alternatives are difﬁcult to evaluate, people often defer a choice. This implication is examined in the present study, using alternatives with probabilistic payoffs in 2 paradigms: the description paradigm—with full probability and payoff information provided at 1 time—and the sampling paradigm—with search revealing 1 payoff at a time and repeated search required to derive probabilities and payoffs. The results show that in both paradigms, choice deferral is less frequent when set size is large. Also, the difﬁculty in evaluating alternatives inﬂuences choice deferral in the description paradigm but not in the sampling paradigm: when a payoff from an alternative can take many possible values, a choice is more likely deferred in the description paradigm. In the sampling paradigm, in contrast, information search is often insufﬁcient for people to recognize the difﬁculty in evaluating alternatives. These results point to a description-experience gap in choice deferral.},

For example, astronomer Johannes Kepler famously interviewed several candidate fiancées sequentially, but was rejected when attempting to return to a previous candidate. Similarly, we examined human performance on searches for attractive faces through fixed-length sequences by adapting optimal stopping computational theory developed from behavioral ecology and economics. Although economics studies have repeatedly found that participants sample too few options before choosing the best-ranked number from a series, we instead found overlong searches with many sequences ending without choice. Participants employed irrationally high choice thresholds, compared to the more lax, realistic standards of a Bayesian ideal observer, which achieved better-ranked faces. We consider several computational accounts and find that participants most resemble a Bayesian model that decides based on altered attractiveness values. These values may produce starkly different biases in the facial attractiveness domain than in other decision domains.},

We investigated whether human participants optimally seek evidence and we characterized the brain areas associated with their evidence seeking. Participants viewed sequences of bead colors drawn from hidden urns and attempted to infer the majority bead color in each urn. When viewing each bead color, participants chose either to seek more evidence about the urn by drawing another bead (draw choices) or to infer the urn contents (urn choices). We then compared their evidence seeking against that predicted by a Bayesian ideal observer model. By this standard, participants sampled less evidence than optimal. Also, when faced with urns that had bead color splits closer to chance (60/40 versus 80/20) or potential monetary losses, participants increased their evidence seeking, but they showed less increase than predicted by the ideal observer model. Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that urn choices evoked larger hemodynamic responses than draw choices in the insula, striatum, anterior cingulate, and parietal cortex. These parietal responses were greater for participants who sought more evidence on average and for participants who increased more their evidence seeking when draws came from 60/40 urns. The parietal cortex and insula were associated with potential monetary loss. Insula responses also showed modulation with estimates of the expected gains of urn choices. Our findings show that participants sought less evidence than predicted by an ideal observer model and their evidence-seeking behavior may relate to responses in the insula and parietal cortex.},

Most lineups adopt a reservation threshold that matches the continuation value closely. Overall, the lineups we study capture 84\% of the gains of a dynamic vs. an optimal ﬁxed threshold. Lineups with more shared playing experience performed better on average.

In many real-world searches, however, distributions are not entirely unknown and can be learned through experience. To investigate learning in such a repeated secretary problem we conduct a large-scale behavioral experiment in which people search repeatedly from ﬁxed distributions. In contrast to prior investigations that ﬁnd no evidence for learning in the classical scenario, in the repeated setting we observe substantial learning resulting in near-optimal stopping behavior. We conduct a Bayesian comparison of multiple behavioral models which shows that participants’ behavior is best described by a class of threshold-based models that contains the theoretically optimal strategy. Fitting such a threshold-based model to data reveals players’ estimated thresholds to be surprisingly close to the optimal thresholds after only a small number of games.},

We examine human performance on variations of the optimal stopping problem, with different environments and with different goals. Speciﬁcally, we consider environments that have relatively high or low numbers, under the goals of choosing the maximum or the minimum. A natural consequence of this design is that we study the decisions that people make in both congruent situations, in which the environment and goal align, and incongruent situations, in which the environment and goal differ. First, we present empirical evidence that people adapt to both high and low environments as well as to both maximum and minimum goal frames, and that they make decisions consistent with using threshold-based models. Second, we apply a previously developed threshold model of individual performance to our data, inferring the thresholds people use. Lastly, we use Bayes factors to test whether people are sensitive to environments, goals, and congruency in optimal stopping problems. Overall, our results suggest that there are psychological similarities in congruent situations, pointing toward invariances and rationalities in the way people solve optimal stopping problems as the environments and goals change, without contaminating framing effects.},

However, excess caution in decision making may also lead to better performance in specific situations where the cost of extended deliberation is small. We compared 16 juvenile OCD patients with 16 matched healthy controls whilst they performed a sequential information gathering task under different external cost conditions. We found that patients with OCD outperformed healthy controls, winning significantly more points. The groups also differed in the number of draws required prior to committing to a decision, but not in decision accuracy. A novel Bayesian computational model revealed that subjective sampling costs arose as a non-linear function of sampling, closely resembling an escalating urgency signal. Group difference in performance was best explained by a later emergence of these subjective costs in the OCD group, also evident in an increased decision threshold. Our findings present a novel computational model and suggest that enhanced information gathering in OCD can be accounted for by a higher decision threshold arising out of an altered perception of costs that, in some specific contexts, may be advantageous.},

By manipulating these assignment probabilities, it was possible to produce stimuli for which exemplar- and rule-based explanations made qualitatively different predictions.F. G. Ashby and J. T. Townsend’s (1986) rule-based general recognition theory provided a better account of the data than R. M. Nosofsky’s (1986) exemplar-based generalized context model in conditions in which the to-be-classified stimuli were relatively confusable. However, generalized context model provided a better account when the stimuli were relatively few and distinct.

	abstract = {We report the results of an experiment in which human subjects were trained to perform a perceptual matching task. Subjects were asked to manipulate comparison objects until they matched target objects using the fewest manipulations possible. An unusual feature of the experimental task is that efﬁcient performance requires an understanding of the hidden or latent causal structure governing the relationships between actions and perceptual outcomes. We use two benchmarks to evaluate the quality of subjects’ learning. One benchmark is based on optimal performance as calculated by a dynamic programming procedure. The other is based on an adaptive computational agent that uses a reinforcement-learning method known as Q-learning to learn to perform the task. Our analyses suggest that subjects were successful learners. In particular, they learned to perform the perceptual matching task in a near-optimal manner (i.e., using a small number of manipulations) at the end of training. Subjects were able to achieve near-optimal performance because they learned, at least partially, the causal structure underlying the task. In addition, subjects’ performances were broadly consistent with those of model-based reinforcement-learning agents that built and used internal models of how their actions inﬂuenced the external environment. We hypothesize that people will achieve near-optimal performances on tasks requiring sequences of action—especially sensorimotor tasks with underlying latent causal structures—when they can detect the effects of their actions on the environment, and when they can represent and reason about these effects using an internal mental model.},

The optimal strategy in these tasks is to choose the first option that is above a threshold that depends on the current position in the sequence. The implicit decision-making strategies by humans vary but largely diverge from this optimal strategy. The reasons for this divergence remain unknown. We present a model of human stopping decisions in sequential decision-making tasks based on a linear threshold heuristic. The first two studies demonstrate that the linear threshold model accounts better for sequential decision making than existing models. Moreover, we show that the model accurately predicts participants’ search behavior in different environments. In the third study, we confirm that the model generalizes to a real-world problem, thus providing an important step toward understanding human sequential decision making.},

	abstract = {In the Sequential Selection Problem (SSP), immediate and irrevocable decisions need to be made as candidates randomly arrive for a job interview. Standard SSP variants, such as the well-known secretary problem, begin with an empty selection set (cold-start) and perform the selection process once over a single candidate set (single-round ). In this paper we address these two limitations. First, we introduce the novel Warm-starting SSP (WSSP) setting which considers at hand a reference set, a set of previously selected items of a given quality, and tries to update optimally that set by (re-)assigning each job at most once. We adopt a cutoﬀ-based approach to optimize a rank-based objective function over the ﬁnal assignment of the jobs. In our technical contribution, we provide analytical results regarding the proposed WSSP setting, we introduce the algorithm Cutoﬀ-based Cost Minimization (CCM) (and the low failures-CCM, which is more robust to high rate of resignations) that adapts to changes in the quality of the reference set thanks to the translation method we propose. Finally, we implement and test CCM in a multi-round setting that is particularly interesting for real-world application scenarios.},

To investigate learning in such settings, we conduct a large-scale behavioral experiment in which people search repeatedly from ﬁxed distributions in a “repeated secretary problem.” In contrast to prior investigations that ﬁnd no evidence for learning in the classical scenario, in the repeated setting we observe substantial learning resulting in near-optimal stopping behavior. We conduct a Bayesian comparison of multiple behavioral models, which shows that participants’ behavior is best described by a class of threshold-based models that contains the theoretically optimal strategy. Fitting such a threshold-based model to data reveals players’ estimated thresholds to be close to the optimal thresholds after only a small number of games.},

Here we explore how people balance the monetary costs and beneﬁts of gathering additional information in a perceptual-motor estimation task. Participants were rewarded for touching a hidden circular target on a touch-screen display. The target’s center coincided with the mean of a circular Gaussian distribution from which participants could sample repeatedly. Each “cue”—sampled one at a time—was plotted as a dot on the display. Participants had to repeatedly decide, after sampling each cue, whether to stop sampling and attempt to touch the hidden target or continue sampling. Each additional cue increased the participants’ probability of successfully touching the hidden target but reduced their potential reward. Two experimental conditions differed in the initial reward associated with touching the hidden target and the ﬁxed cost per cue. For each condition we computed the optimal number of cues that participants should sample, before taking action, to maximize expected gain. Contrary to recent claims that people gather less information than they objectively should before taking action, we found that participants oversampled in one experimental condition, and did not signiﬁcantly undersample or oversample in the other. Additionally, while the ideal observer model ignores the current sample dispersion, we found that participants used it to decide whether to stop sampling and take action or continue sampling, a possible consequence of imperfect learning of the underlying population dispersion across trials.},

            Optimal decisions across extended time horizons require value calculations over multiple probabilistic future states. Humans may circumvent such complex computations by resorting to easy-to-compute heuristics that approximate optimal solutions. To probe the potential interplay between heuristic and optimal computations, we develop a novel sequential decision-making task, framed as virtual foraging in which participants have to avoid virtual starvation. Rewards depend only on final outcomes over five-trial blocks, necessitating planning over five sequential decisions and probabilistic outcomes. Here, we report model comparisons demonstrating that participants primarily rely on the best available heuristic but also use the normatively optimal policy. FMRI signals in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) relate to heuristic and optimal policies and associated choice uncertainties. Crucially, reaction times and dorsal MPFC activity scale with discrepancies between heuristic and optimal policies. Thus, sequential decision-making in humans may emerge from integration between heuristic and optimal policies, implemented by controllers in MPFC.},

We present empirical evidence that suggests people use threshold-based models to make decisions, choosing the first currently maximal number that exceeds a fixed threshold for that position in the list. We then develop a hierarchical generative account of this model family, and use Bayesian methods to learn about the parameters of the generative process, making inferences about the threshold decision models people use. We discuss the interesting aspects of human performance on the task, including the lack of learning, and the presence of large individual differences, and consider the possibility of extending the modeling framework to account for individual differences.

Within risky versions of the spatially correlated multi-armed bandit task, we show that participants’ behavior is aligned well with a Gaussian process function learning algorithm, which chooses points based on a safe optimization routine. Moreover, using leave-oneblock-out cross-validation, we ﬁnd that participants adapt their sampling behavior to the riskiness of the task, although the underlying function learning mechanism remains relatively unchanged. These results show that participants can adapt their search behavior to the adversity of the environment and enrich our understanding of adaptive behavior in the face of risk and uncertainty.},

While previous post-decision search studies focused on “one-shot” decisions and highlighted its irrational aspects, here we explore the possible beneﬁts of post-decision search in the long run. We use a simple search task in which participants repeatedly decide whether to select the current alternative or continue to search for a better alternative. In a preliminary study we ﬁnd that participants indeed conduct post-decision search even in unique environments, where information about forgone options cannot be used in future choices. In the main studies exposure to post-decision information was manipulated directly in unique environments, and was found to lead to better performance. The source of the observed improvement was further investigated with an explicit strategy elicitation methodology. We ﬁnd that following exposure to post-decision information, people collect more data before generating thresholds. Thus, although post-decision search in unique environments might appear redundant, our results suggest it can help decision makers to modify their strategy and improve their future choices.},

However, in the two no-cost conditions subjects search too little in comparison to the optimal model, whereas in the two cost conditions they search too much.

	abstract = {We study the numerical performance of a limited memory quasi-Newton method for large scale optimization, which we call the L-BFGS method. We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckleyand LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence On uniformly convex problems.},

Unfortunately, however, the classical p-value comes with a number of well-documented drawbacks. Here we outline an alternative, Bayes factor method to quantify the evidence for and against the hypothesis of independence in R × C contingency tables. First we describe different sampling models for contingency tables and provide the corresponding default Bayes factors as originally developed by Gunel and Dickey (Biometrika, 61(3):545–557 (1974)). We then illustrate the properties and advantages of a Bayes factor analysis of contingency tables through simulations and practical examples.

	abstract = {Objective: Approximately 28 million individuals engage in alcohol-impaired driving (AID) every year. This study investigated individuals‘ AID decision making strategies under intoxication, their variability across the breath alcohol concentration curve (BrAC), and the association between strategy and AID attitudes and intentions. Method: 79 adults (mean 23.9 years, 57\% female) who drank alcohol ≥2 days per week and lived {\textgreater}2 miles away from their typical drinking locations completed an alcohol administration protocol and AID decision making task. AID attitudes, intentions, and behaviors were assessed repeatedly across the BrAC curve. Bayesian cognitive modeling identified decision strategies used by individuals on the AID decision making task, revealing whether alcohol consumption level and/or ride service cost factored into individuals‘ decisions to drive while impaired or obtain a ride. Additional analyses tested whether AID attitudes and intentions were related to individuals‘ decision strategies. Results: Two decision strategies were examined on the ascending and descending limb of the BrAC curve: compensatory (both consumption level and ride service cost factored into AID decisions) and non-compensatory (only consumption level factored into AID decisions). Switching to a compensatory strategy on the descending limb was associated with lower perceived intoxication, perceiving AID as less dangerous, and being willing to drive above the legal BrAC limit. Conclusions: Results suggest that risk for engaging in AID is higher for those using a cost-sensitive, compensatory strategy when making AID decisions under intoxication. Future research is needed to test whether AID countermeasures (e.g., subsidized ride services) are differentially effective according to decision strategy type.},

This study used a novel decision task to evaluate whether individuals considered both ride service cost and alcohol consumption level when deciding whether or not to drive, and whether the resulting strategy was associated with engagement in AID. Design A two-sample study, where sample 1 developed a novel AID decision task to classify participants by decision strategy. Sample 2 was used to cross-validate the task and examine whether decision strategy classiﬁcations were predictive of prior reported AID behavior. Setting A laboratory setting at the University of Missouri, USA. Participants Sample 1 included 38 student participants from introductory psychology classes at the University of Missouri. Sample 2 included 67 young adult participants recruited from the local community. Measurements We developed a decision task that presented hypothetical drinking scenarios that varied in quantity of alcohol consumption (one to six drinks) and the cost of a ride service (\$5–25). We applied a Bayesian computational model to classify choices as consistent with either: integrating both ride cost and consumption level (compensatory) or considering only consumption level (non-compensatory) when making hypothetical AID decisions. In sample 2, we assessed established AID risk factors (sex, recent alcohol consumption, perceived safe limit) and recent (past 3 months) engagement in AID. Findings In sample 1, the majority of participants were classiﬁed as using decision strategies consistent with either a compensatory or non-compensatory process. Results from sample 2 replicated the overall classiﬁcation rate and demonstrated that participants who used a compensatory strategy were more likely to report recent AID, even after accounting for study covariates. Conclusions In a hypothetical alcohol-impaired driving (AID) decision task, individuals who considered both consumption level and ride service cost were more likely to report recent AID than those who made decisions based entirely on consumption level.},

This allows us to measure population probabilities with some precision; since we do this for all non-degenerate menus of a given domain, we expose every implication of each of the axioms to possible falsiﬁcation. Each participant faces exactly one menu from each domain, making this a strictly between-subject design; unlike similar studies with within-subject or mixed designs, the standard assumption that choices are independent, and on each menu, identically distributed, is innocuous.

Guided by this framework, we show in two online choice experiments (total N = 954 adults) that manipulating the commensurability of attributes leads to different patterns of context effects. Robust attraction and compromise effects are found when attributes are incommensurable (e.g., CPU speed in GHz and RAM memory in GB, or quality ratings on different scales), and mostly null effects occur when attributes are commensurable (e.g., quality ratings on the same scale). Our ﬁndings show how the format of choice information can substantially alter the integration of that information and resulting choice patterns.},

Instead, they show that when people learn preferences in context (e.g., through repeated choices made from a trinary choice set that includes an asymmetrically dominated decoy), they learn a context-specific choice heuristic (e.g., they always choose the asymmetrically dominating option), which leads to less consistent preferences across contexts. In contrast, repeated choices from sets containing only two options impel people to learn their subjective attribute weights, yielding preferences that are consistent across contexts. The difference between choice construction and preference construction is of importance to marketing managers because repeat purchase is typically interpreted as a signal of customer preference. The authors show that this “preference” might just be a learned solution to the choice problem and that as soon as the competitive context changes (even in a normatively meaningless way), so will consumers’ preferences.},

Evaluators first seek a reference value on the target attribute (e.g., an average value or another stimulus’s value on that same attribute). However, in the absence of same-attribute information, evaluators may instead rely on the target stimulus’s own value on another attribute and make an evaluation about the target in one of two ways. First, the individual may compare the target attribute value to the stimulus’s value on a reference attribute. The evaluator is more likely to engage in an interattribute comparison when the target attribute value is relatively evaluable and compatible with the reference value. Second, the individual may infer the magnitude of the target value based on his or her judgment about the extremity (e.g., the goodness or badness) of the stimulus’s value on a reference attribute and the perceived correlation between the target attribute and the reference attribute. The evaluator is more likely to make an inference about the target value based on the reference when the target is low in evaluability and is less compatible with the reference value. Two attribute values are considered to be more compatible when their scale format is more similar. We provide support for our framework in 14 studies.},

In two experiments, students studied prose passages and took one or three immediate free-recall tests, without feedback, or restudied the material the same number of times as the students who received tests. Students then took a ﬁnal retention test 5 min, 2 days, or 1 week later. When the ﬁnal test was given after 5 min, repeated studying improved recall relative to repeated testing. However, on the delayed tests, prior testing produced substantially greater retention than studying, even though repeated studying increased students’ conﬁdence in their ability to remember the material. Testing is a powerful means of improving learning, not just assessing it.},

Separable dimensions are easy to attend in isolation, while integral dimensions are not. Little et al. (2016) showed that when trial-by-trial responses are analyzed, a consistent pattern of sequential effects was found in a modiﬁed Garner paradigm using integral-dimension stimuli. The present experiments investigated whether these pronounced sequential effects are also found with separable-dimension stimuli. Four experiments using two different types of separable dimensions were conducted. The results indicated that similar patterns of sequential effects were present for separable-dimension stimuli, but, unlike for integral dimensions, the effect of a change in the irrelevant dimension in the ﬁltering task was not found. Further, for separable dimensions, the overall pattern of sequential effects did not vary between the Garner tasks (i.e., control, correlated, and ﬁltering). To explain these results, we ﬁt a sequence-sensitive exemplar model and compared the ﬁts of this model to a novel sequence-sensitive feature model, in which only the relevant feature inﬂuences the categorization decision. We found that the full exemplar model provided a more compelling account of both our separable dimension data and the integral dimension data of Little et al. (2016). These ﬁndings provide a more complete understanding of perceptual categorization and add to the growing body of literature on the prevalence and critical implications of strong sequential effects in cognitive tasks.},

The difference between HWTP and RWTP is the Bhypothetical bias.{\textasciicircum} A prevalent assumption in marketing science is that indirect methods measure WTP more accurately than do direct methods. With a meta-analysis of 77 studies reported in 47 papers and resulting in 115 effect sizes, we test that assumption by assessing the hypothetical bias. The total sample consists of 24,347 included observations for HWTP and 20,656 for RWTP. Moving beyond extant meta-analyses in marketing, we introduce an effect size metric (i.e., response ratio) and a novel analysis method (i.e., multivariate mixed linear model) to analyze the stochastically dependent effect sizes. Our findings are relevant for academic researchers and managers. First, on average, the hypothetical bias is 21\%, and this study provides a reference point for the expected magnitude of the hypothetical bias. Second, the deviation primarily depends on the use of a direct or indirect method for measuring HWTP. In contrast with conventional wisdom, indirect methods actually overestimate RWTP significantly stronger than direct methods. Third, the hypothetical bias is greater for higher valued products, specialty goods (cf. other product types), and within-subject designs (cf. between-subject designs), thus a stronger downward adjustment of HWTP values is necessary to reflect consumers’ RWTP.},

We connect these interpretations to models of utility maximization that account for point and budget constraints and investigate the role of budget constraints in more detail. We show how these constraints impact the regression speci­ fications for point allocation experiments that are commonly used in the literature. We also show how a formulation of a taste for variety as entropy that had been previously used to analyse market shares can fruitfully be applied to choice behaviour in point allocation experiments.},

These methods rely on assessing the monotonicity of a set of responses embedded within a state-space. Prince et al.

Under the assumption that the population is homogeneous, these Bayes factors can be combined across participants to produce a ‘‘group’’ Bayes factor comparing the monotone hypothesis to the non-monotone hypothesis. However, combining information across individuals without assuming homogeneity is problematic due to the nonparametric nature of state-trace analysis. We introduce group-level Bayes factors that can be used to assess the evidence that the population is homogeneous vs. heterogeneous, and demonstrate their utility using data from a visual change-detection task. Additionally, we describe new computational methods for rapidly computing individual-level Bayes factors.},

	abstract = {State trace analyses assess the latent dimensionality of a cognitive process by asking whether the means of two dependent variables conform to a monotonic function across a set of conditions. Using an assumption of independence between the measures, recently proposed statistical tests address bivariate measurement error, allowing both frequentist and Bayesian analyses of monotonicity (e.g., Davis-Stober, Morey, Gretton, \& Heathcote, 2016; Kalish, Dunn, Burdakov, \& Sysoev, 2016). However, statistical inference can be biased by unacknowledged dependencies between measures, particularly when the data are insufficient to overwhelm an incorrect prior assumption of independence. To address this limitation, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model that explicitly models the separate roles of subject, item, and trial-level dependencies between two measures. Assessment of monotonicity is then performed by fitting separate models that do or do not allow a non-monotonic relation between the condition effects (i.e., same versus different rank orders). The Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) and Pseudo Bayesian Model Averaging – both cross validation measures of model fit – are used for model comparison, providing an inferential conclusion regarding the dimensionality of the latent psychological space. We validated this new state trace analysis technique using model recovery simulation studies, which assumed different ground truths regarding monotonicity and the direction/magnitude of the subject- and trial-level dependence. We also provide an example application of this new technique to a visual object learning study that compared performance on a visual retrieval task (forced choice part recognition) versus a verbal retrieval task (cued recall).},

The basic assumption of both the MNL model and the independent probit (IP) model is independence of utilities between alternatives, also referred to as IID assumption. Since the MNL model in addition exhibits the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) property, it is often directly concluded that the IP model likewise exhibits the IIA property, thereby relating IID to IIA. However, this is not true considering Luce’s deﬁnition of the IIA property. The objective of this paper is twofold: First, we clarify that IID does not imply IIA in the speciﬁc context of the IP model. Second, we work out the sources for the non-proportional shifting of the ratio of choice shares that distinguishes the IP model from the MNL model. Accordingly, we ﬁrst theoretically review the true property of the IP model and subsequently illustrate with a conjoint example that the IP model does not exhibit the IIA property. In addition, we provide a case-by-case analysis to explain the non-proportional shifting of choice shares in the substitution pattern of the IP model and work out the principles for that nonproportional shifting mechanism.},

Early studies emphasized the relational properties of choice alternatives and indicated that the middle option, whose attribute values fall between the values of other alternatives, is always the compromise option. More recent studies have suggested that when consumers rate two attributes with the same metrics, the attribute–balance choice whose two attributes have equal ratings, might represent the compromise choice. We propose that the different characteristics of the middle and attribute–balance options—which may be compatible with certain determinants such as information and task formats—might be more salient and affect the relative attractiveness of each option. The results of three experiments conﬁrmed this prediction: the middle option was more attractive in list-by-attributes and rejecting conditions, whereas the attribute–balance option was more attractive in list-by-alternatives and choosing conditions.

	abstract = {The paradoxical findings in consumer choice research have captivated the interest of many scholars from diverse fields and transformed the understanding of consumer decision-making. This paper is the first attempt to systematically review, synthesize, and integrate the paradoxical findings in consumer choice research. One of the first paradoxical findings was the violations of value maximation models of rational choice. The second important paradox in consumer choice research is the puzzling role of variety in consumer choices. We focus on these two critical paradoxes discovered in consumer choice literature over the last five decades and refer to them as the “paradox of rational choice” and the “paradox of variety.” We conducted a co-citation cluster analysis to help identify the most significant studies in the domain. The cluster analysis helped eliminate the subjective bias in article selection. We also used inferential analysis to widen the scope of clusters to other relevant and especially recent studies. A review of 233 papers published between 1972 and 2023 reveals the four themes covering the two paradoxes of consumer choice. The first theme covers the first paradox: the paradox of rational choice. It presents research on preference reversals and other violations of value maximization rational choice models due to contextual factors and choice environment. The following three themes cover the second paradox of consumer choice: the paradox of variety. The second theme focuses on the benefits of variety and the natural desire of consumers to seek more variety. Paradoxically, the third theme highlights when and why variety will likely cause harmful psychological consequences for consumers. Finally, the last theme reconciles the opposing ideas of themes two and three by identifying the boundary conditions and suggesting ways to resolve this paradox. We also provide research directions that scholars can consider for future research related to each of these themes.},

	abstract = {Studies of contextual choice typically use three option choice sets to evaluate how preference relations depend on the values of a third decoy option. However, often real-world decisions are made using choice sets with many more than three alternatives, such as in online shopping. Three experiments tested for attraction and compromise decoy effects in choice sets that varied the number and ordering of alternatives using a within-subjects preferential choice grocery shopping task. In Experiment 1, attraction and compromise effects were significantly reduced as alternatives increased from three to nine. Experiment 2 found significantly greater attraction effects in nine alternative choice sets ordered by attributes compared with a random ordering. Experiment 3 used eye tracking and found significant attraction effects in choice sets with 3, 9, and 15 alternatives, but the effect was reduced with increasing alternatives. Eye tracking revealed that participants engaged in more bydimension comparisons as the number of alternatives increased, but, contrary to previous research, the proportion of by-alternative to by-dimension transitions was not linearly predictive of decoy effects. With increased alternatives, the proportion of the total information attended to decreased, leading to worse choice outcomes, and participants were more likely to engage in a lexicographic decision-making strategy.},

	abstract = {Inclusion of a decoy alternative dominated by a target option, but not its competitor, typically leads to increased choice for the target over the competitor, known as the attraction effect. However, the reverse sometimes occurs, known as the repulsion effect. This research tested factors that moderate the repulsion effect in preferential choice scenarios with numerical attributes. Experiment 1 used a between-subjects design with a small set of consumer products and demonstrated robust repulsion effects that did not depend on the relative similarity of the decoy and target. Experiments 2 and 4 used a more powerful within-subjects design along with an expanded set of products and showed that repulsion effects were generally enhanced when the decoy and target had more similar attributes; however, the moderating effect of decoy–target similarity appeared to be fragile and sensitive to stimulus presentation factors. These ﬁndings provided mixed support for the hypothesis that the target is tainted by its proximity to the decoy. Experiments 3 and 5 tested whether the extremity of values on the attribute favoring the target moderates the repulsion effect. The results demonstrated that repulsion is more likely when all the alternatives have extremely high values on the target’s better attribute. Extremity of attribute values on the dimension favoring the target may result in a categorical assessment along that dimension and shift focus to the attribute favoring the competitor as one way to foster the repulsion effect.},

	abstract = {There is an emerging consensus among disciplines dealing with human decision making that the context in which a decision is made is an important determinant of outcomes. This consensus has been slow in the making because much of what is known about context effects has evolved from a desire to demonstrate the untenability of certain common assumptions upon which tractable models of behavior have generally been built. This paper seeks to bring disparate disciplinary perspectives to bear on the relation between context and choice, to formulate (1) recommendations for improvements to the state-of-the-practice of Random Utility Models (RUMs) of choice behavior, and (2) a future research agenda to guide the further incorporation of context into these models of choice behavior.},

	abstract = {When decision-makers are faced with a choice among multiple options that have several attributes, preferences are often influenced by how the options are related to one another. For example, consumer preferences can be influenced, and even reversed, by the context defined by available products. This article discusses three standard context effects found in the preferential-choice literature: the attraction, similarity, and compromise effects. While decision theorists have attempted to explain these three effects under single modeling accounts, it has never before been demonstrated that these effects can be obtained within the same experimental paradigm. A set of experiments is described that demonstrate the three effects in an inference task. The paradigm is completely novel, as no previous experimental work has examined the standard context effects in inference. The experiments also add to evidence that the effects are not confined to choices among options with affective value, such as consumer products. The experimental results provide evidence that these effects might be a general property of human choice behavior and bring into question explanations of the effects that are based on the concept of loss-aversion asymmetry.},
